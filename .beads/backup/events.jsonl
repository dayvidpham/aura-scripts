Failed transitions must be recorded in the audit trail (transition_history) with error context. Mutation test exception specificity (SLICE-1 bare except) must also be addressed.\\n- Findings: aura-plugins-3xe, aura-plugins-6wg, aura-plugins-i2g, aura-plugins-295\\n\\n### FR2: Constraint Completeness — Full 22 C-* Coverage\\nExpand `RuntimeConstraintChecker.check_all()` to aggregate all 22 C-* constraint checks defined in schema.xml. Each constraint must have a dedicated method. `check_severity_tree()` must enforce the POSITIVE case of C-severity-eager (p10 MUST have 3 severity groups eagerly). EpochState needs a `severity_groups` field to enable runtime enforcement.\\n- Findings: aura-plugins-yno, aura-plugins-jwb, aura-plugins-947, aura-plugins-bnr\\n\\n### FR3: Type Safety Hardening — Strongly-Typed Enums Throughout\\nChange `EpochState.current_role` from `str` to `RoleId`. Document TYPE_CHECKING Protocol limitations (isinstance checks only method name presence, not full signature) in interfaces.py module docstring. Add test verifying `RuntimeConstraintChecker` satisfies `ConstraintValidatorInterface` Protocol.\\n- Findings: aura-plugins-tcn, aura-plugins-don, aura-plugins-ngd, aura-plugins-5zf\\n\\n### FR4: Temporal Integration Testing — Sandbox End-to-End\\nAdd `WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping()` integration tests for EpochWorkflow. Decouple timestamp from `advance()` by passing timestamp as explicit parameter. Test actual Temporal signal delivery (advance_phase, submit_vote) in sandbox.\\n- Findings: aura-plugins-68o, aura-plugins-gdx, aura-plugins-o83\\n\\n### FR5: MINOR Bundled Cleanup\\nAddress all MINOR findings alongside their IMPORTANT siblings:\\n- Duplicated `_advance_to` helper → shared conftest.py fixture (aura-plugins-sk6, aura-plugins-0yd)\\n- `DataPart.data` and `ToolCall` dict fields → `dict[str, Any]` (aura-plugins-utj, aura-plugins-eqy)\\n- `FilePart.file_uri` → document A2A migration path (aura-plugins-7d2, aura-plugins-hls)\\n- `SA_EPOCH_ID` per-transition upsert → document or make defensive (aura-plugins-xui, aura-plugins-r8f)\\n- `check_blocker_gate` constraint_id naming (aura-plugins-dvi, aura-plugins-qqf)\\n- `_SAME_ACTOR` frozenset → module-level constant (aura-plugins-pxo)\\n- `AuditEvent.payload` str → typed pattern (aura-plugins-h7x)\\n- Test `__import__` inline → top-level import (aura-plugins-v1b)\\n- Test hardcoded constraint subset → full set verification (aura-plugins-8jy)\\n- `TransitionRecord` post-hoc mutation → pass timestamp into advance (aura-plugins-x36, aura-plugins-3m4)\\n- `EpochState.current_role` str→RoleId (aura-plugins-1ic, aura-plugins-4hu)\\n- `ToolCall` hashability test documentation (aura-plugins-4u1)\\n\\n## Constraints\\n- C-backwards: Must not break existing 475 tests\\n- C-no-new-deps: No new pip packages — only stdlib + existing deps (temporalio, pytest, pytest-asyncio)\\n- C-python-only: All code in aura-plugins must be Python (R7 from original URD)\\n\\n## Priorities (User-Stated)\\n1. All 4 IMPORTANT themes equally prioritized\\n2. MINOR findings bundled with their IMPORTANT siblings (same-slice, same-pass)\\n3. Full 22 C-* constraint coverage (not a subset)\\n\\n## MVP Goals\\n- check_all() covers all 22 C-* constraints with dedicated methods\\n- EpochWorkflow.run() catches only TransitionError, records failures\\n- EpochState.current_role typed as RoleId\\n- WorkflowEnvironment sandbox tests for signal delivery\\n- All MINOR cleanup addressed alongside IMPORTANT siblings\\n- 475+ tests pass (existing + new)\\n\\n## End-Vision Alignment\\nThis follow-up closes the gap between v1 MVP and the URD (aura-plugins-umi) requirements for:\\n- Forensic auditability (FR1: failed transitions recorded)\\n- Complete constraint enforcement surface (FR2: all 22 C-*)\\n- Strongly-typed protocol invariants (FR3: no str leaks)\\n- Temporal workflow confidence (FR4: sandbox tests prove signal delivery)\"}","old_value":"{\"id\":\"aura-plugins-s6i\",\"title\":\"FOLLOWUP_URD: Requirements for aura_protocol v1 follow-up\",\"description\":\"---\\nreferences:\\n  followup_epic: aura-plugins-2tj\\n  original_urd: aura-plugins-umi\\n---\\nFollow-up requirements.

Address opportunistically or in a future pass. |\\n| Close as won't-fix | Close MINOR severity groups — these are polish items that do not affect correctness or architecture. |\\n\\n**A:** Bundle with IMPORTANT. Address MINOR findings alongside their IMPORTANT siblings in the same slices — less overhead, one pass.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Round 1, Q3: Constraint Coverage Target (singleSelect)\\n\\n**Q:** For constraint completeness: check_all() only covers 5/22 constraints. What coverage target do you want?\\n\\n| Option | Description |\\n|--------|-------------|\\n| All 22 C-* constraints | Full coverage — check_all() aggregates every constraint defined in schema.xml. Most thorough but largest scope. |\\n| Transition-relevant subset | Only add constraints that are checkable against EpochState at transition time. Some C-* constraints are documentation-level and may not map to runtime checks. |\\n| Keep 5, document gap | Keep current 5 methods, add docstring/comment explaining which constraints are not runtime-checkable and why. Smallest scope. |\\n\\n**A:** All 22 C-* constraints. Full coverage — check_all() aggregates every constraint defined in schema.xml.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Round 1, Q4: Catch-All (multiSelect)\\n\\n**Q:** Anything else about the follow-up scope, constraints, or priorities?\\n\\n| Option | Description |\\n|--------|-------------|\\n| Must not break 475 tests | All changes must be backwards-compatible with existing test suite. |\\n| Minimize new dependencies | No new pip packages — only stdlib + existing deps (temporalio, pytest). |\\n| Nothing else | Covered everything above. |\\n\\n**A:** Must not break 475 tests + Minimize new dependencies.

All 7 review focus areas are satisfied.\\n\\n## Review Summary (Axis B — Test Quality)\\n\\n### 1. Test Strategy Sufficiency\\n\\nThe 4 new test files (test_schema_parser.py, test_gen_schema.py, test_gen_skills.py, test_context_injection.py) plus extensions to test_schema_types_sync.py provide complete coverage mapped to all new modules. Each new module has a dedicated test file. The mapping is 1:1 with module boundaries (schema_parser ↔ test_schema_parser, gen_schema ↔ test_gen_schema, gen_skills ↔ test_gen_skills, context_injection ↔ test_context_injection). This aligns with the existing pattern (constraints.py ↔ test_constraints.py, state_machine.py ↔ test_state_machine.py). No module is untested.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE.\\n\\n### 2. Error Path Coverage\\n\\nAC1a specifies 3+ error-path tests for SchemaParseError with named failure inputs: malformed XML (truncated), missing required sections (e.g. `\\u003cphases\\u003e`), and missing required attributes. SchemaParseError is defined as a proper exception class with a clear docstring. The validation checklist has a dedicated entry.\\n\\nAC4a specifies three distinct marker edge cases for MarkerError: (1) missing END marker → raise, (2) missing both markers → generate full content (clean path), (3) reversed markers → raise. The \\\"should not silently discard body on any boundary error\\\" invariant is the correct safety clause. MarkerError is defined as a ValueError subclass.\\n\\nTogether these are 6+ named error scenarios across 2 error types. The mutation-based approach from test_validate_schema.py provides a strong conceptual model that test_schema_parser.py can follow (inject bad inputs, assert specific exception with correct type).\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE.\\n\\n### 3. Round-Trip Test Design\\n\\nAC3 specifies \\\"field-by-field comparison\\\" and the validation checklist says \\\"(not count-only)\\\". The existing test_schema_types_sync.py at lines 294-308 (TestConstraintSpecsMatchSchema.test_constraint_given_when_then_match_schema) already demonstrates the correct pattern: iterate schema elements, look up the Python spec by ID, and assert each field individually (given, when, then). This is the exact model for AC3.\\n\\nThe proposal names specific fields per entity type in AC3: ConstraintSpec.given/when/then/should_not, HandoffSpec.required_fields, SubstepSpec.startup_sequence. These are concrete anchors that prevent count-only assertions. The test_gen_schema round-trip direction is: types.py → gen_schema → parse_schema → field-level comparison, which is a true integration test of two new modules working together. The prior Round 2 review B (aura-plugins-qt1p) correctly identified that AC3 should cover should_not (missing from the existing test_schema_types_sync.py pattern) — and the proposal now includes it explicitly.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE. The model is demonstrated in the existing codebase and the proposal correctly extends it.\\n\\n### 4. Absence Testing\\n\\nAC5a names concrete constraint IDs: C-worker-gates must NOT appear in get_role_context(SUPERVISOR); C-supervisor-no-impl must NOT appear in get_role_context(WORKER). AC6a: C-severity-eager must NOT appear in get_phase_context(P4_REVIEW); C-review-consensus must NOT appear in get_phase_context(P9_SLICE).\\n\\nThese are precise, falsifiable assertions against specific string identifiers. They test the SUT's output (the returned frozenset), not internal state. They follow the project's convention of asserting observable outcomes. The validation checklist has two dedicated entries (\\\"get_role_context does NOT include irrelevant constraints\\\", \\\"get_phase_context does NOT include irrelevant constraints\\\").\\n\\nOne observation: these absence tests rely on the static _ROLE_CONSTRAINTS and _PHASE_CONSTRAINTS dicts in context_injection.py being correctly populated. Since these dicts are hand-authored (not derived from schema.xml structurally), the tests need to be robust enough that they catch errors in that hand-authored data. The named constraint IDs (C-worker-gates, C-supervisor-no-impl) provide exactly the right anchors.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE.\\n\\n### 5. Regression Safety\\n\\nAC7 states \\\"all 554 existing tests pass\\\" and AC11 (Temporal Isolation) states \\\"all sandbox tests pass unchanged\\\" with an explicit enumeration of the 6 Temporal-serialized types that must NOT be modified (EpochState, TransitionRecord, EpochInput, EpochResult, PhaseAdvanceSignal, ReviewVoteSignal). The \\\"unchanged\\\" files list explicitly includes state_machine.py, constraints.py, workflow.py, interfaces.py — all of which have comprehensive existing tests (test_state_machine.py ~120, test_constraints.py ~180, test_workflow.py ~60, test_interfaces.py ~40).\\n\\nThe HandoffSpec.content_level str→ContentLevel change (the one non-additive modification) is correctly called out in the proposal as requiring test_schema_types_sync.py to update (line 346 comparison `spec.content_level == h.get(\\\"content-level\\\")` will need to compare the enum value string, not the enum itself).\\n\\nOne specific gap: the proposal does not explicitly call out that test_schema_types_sync.py's TestHandoffSpecsMatchSchema.test_handoff_roles_match_schema will need updating for the content_level field after the str→ContentLevel change. This is a valid implementation concern but it is traceable from the validation checklist (\\\"test_schema_types_sync.py covers all new canonical dicts\\\") and the \\\"modified files\\\" table (test_schema_types_sync.py listed as modified). A worker reading both sections can connect the dots.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE. The regression strategy is sound. The one gap (content_level comparison update) is traceable from proposal text.\\n\\n### 6. Integration Test Coverage\\n\\nAC10 specifies the end-to-end pipeline test: parse_schema → populate types → gen_schema → validate_schema → gen_skills. This exercises all 4 new modules in sequence plus the existing validate_schema.py. This is a true integration test — not a mock-based test — because it runs the actual parsing, generation, and validation logic. It follows the project's convention (test_validate_schema.py already tests validate_schema.py via both the library API and subprocess CLI).\\n\\nThe prior Round 2 Review B (aura-plugins-qt1p) noted the \\\"pipeline direction ambiguity\\\" in AC10 (bootstrap vs. steady-state) as an IMPORTANT finding. PROPOSAL-3 does not resolve this ambiguity — AC10 still reads \\\"parse_schema → populate types → gen_schema → validate_schema → gen_skills\\\" which mixes bootstrap (schema→Python) and steady-state (Python→schema) steps. The validation checklist uses the slightly different phrasing \\\"parse → gen_schema → validate → gen_skills\\\" which omits \\\"populate types\\\".\\n\\nThis is the same IMPORTANT finding from Round 2 — not a new BLOCKER. Workers can resolve it by reading both documents together, and the checklist phrasing is the more actionable guide. Both pipeline directions are valid to test.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE for a plan-review vote. The ambiguity is pre-existing, documented, and not a blocker.\\n\\n### 7. Existing Test Pattern Alignment\\n\\nReading conftest.py and test_schema_types_sync.py reveals the following conventions:\\n- Class-per-concern grouping (TestPhaseIdMatchesSchema, TestConstraintSpecsMatchSchema, etc.)\\n- Module-scoped fixtures for expensive resources (schema_root fixture with scope=\\\"module\\\")\\n- Field-level assertions with informative error messages (f-string showing both sides)\\n- pytest.mark.parametrize for combinatorial coverage (mutation tests, template rendering across 4 roles)\\n- from __future__ import annotations at the top\\n- Absolute Path construction via Path(__file__).resolve().parent\\n\\nThe proposal's test design aligns well with these conventions:\\n- AC8 uses pytest.mark.parametrize over 4 role templates (aligns with TestMutationDetection pattern)\\n- AC3 round-trip uses field-level assertions (aligns with test_constraint_given_when_then_match_schema pattern)\\n- test_schema_parser.py error paths can use SchemaFixture-style mutation injection\\n- The module-scoped schema_root fixture from test_schema_types_sync.py should be shared or replicated in test_gen_schema.py — the proposal does not explicitly specify this, but it is implied by the existing pattern\\n\\nOne alignment gap: the proposal does not specify whether the new test files should use module-scoped fixtures for the parse_schema() call (expensive XML parse). This is a minor implementation detail the worker should follow from convention, not a plan-level concern.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE. Proposal aligns with existing conventions.\\n\\n## Verdict\\n\\nAll 7 review focus areas are satisfied. The test strategy is comprehensive, well-anchored in named failure inputs and named constraint IDs, field-level comparison is modelled on existing code, regression safety is explicitly scoped, and integration coverage exercises all 4 new modules end-to-end. No new blockers identified beyond the pre-existing AC10 direction ambiguity (already documented in prior Round 2 review as IMPORTANT, not BLOCKER).\\n\\nVOTE: ACCEPT\"}","old_value":"{\"id\":\"aura-plugins-k7de\",\"title\":\"PROPOSAL-3-REVIEW-B-1: Schema-driven v2 — Test Quality\",\"description\":\"---\\nreferences:\\n  proposal: aura-plugins-mg6h\\n  urd: aura-plugins-w07o\\n  followup_urd: aura-plugins-s6i\\n---\\nReviewer B (Test Quality) review of PROPOSAL-3.\",\"status\":\"open\",\"priority\":2,\"issue_type\":\"task\",\"owner\":\"dayvidpham@gmail.com\",\"created_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:26:44Z\",\"created_by\":\"David Huu Pham\",\"updated_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:26:44Z\",\"labels\":[\"aura:p4-plan:s4-review\"]}"}
{"actor":"David Huu Pham","comment":null,"created_at":"2026-02-22T15:29:03Z","event_type":"updated","id":383,"issue_id":"aura-plugins-tbdc","new_value":"{\"description\":\"VOTE: ACCEPT\\n\\n## Reviewer C (Elegance and Complexity Matching) — PROPOSAL-3, Round 1\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Changed from PROPOSAL-2 (previously 3/3 ACCEPT)\\n\\nPROPOSAL-3 adds to the already-ratified PROPOSAL-2:\\n1. Existing Foundation inventory (full v1+followup accounting)\\n2. Integration architecture diagram (explicit module-to-existing-code mapping)\\n3. Temporal compatibility analysis (no breaking changes to serialized types)\\n4. Modified vs new files delineation (clear ownership per file)\\n5. Gap analysis findings from 4 explore agents (SubstepSpec, DelegateSpec, 6 missing enums)\\n6. AC11: Temporal Isolation (new, explicit, machine-verifiable AC)\\n7. content_level str→ContentLevel enum fix (non-breaking type-safety improvement)\\n\\nNone of these additions introduce new modules, new abstractions, or new complexity. They are documentation improvements and a minor type-safety fix. The underlying architecture is unchanged.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Sub-Axis Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Complexity Proportionality\\n\\nThe added elements are proportionate:\\n- Gap analysis → 2 additional dataclasses (SubstepSpec, DelegateSpec) and 6 missing enums found by explore agents. These are discoveries, not invented complexity. Schema.xml has these entities; the types should represent them.\\n- AC11 (Temporal Isolation) is a zero-implementation-cost AC — the existing Temporal types are unchanged; the test just verifies the sandbox tests still pass. This is pure guard rail.\\n- content_level enum change: one field type corrected. Non-breaking because HandoffSpec is not Temporal-serialized. The proposal documents this reasoning explicitly.\\n\\n### 2. Module Decomposition — Unchanged, Still Clean\\n\\n4 new modules: schema_parser, gen_schema, gen_skills, context_injection. Each has single responsibility. Dependency graph remains a tree: generators and context_injection import types.py only, never each other. No circular dependencies possible. The integration architecture diagram confirms this explicitly.\\n\\n### 3. context_injection.py Static Dict Approach — Adequate\\n\\nThe static dict approach for constraint→role and constraint→phase mappings is justified: the proposal correctly notes that this mapping is NOT structurally encoded in schema.xml (it's in the 'given:' text of constraints). The two options are (a) static dict or (b) parse free-text given: clauses at runtime. Option (b) would add fragility (free-text parsing) for no gain. Option (a) is correct. The approach matches the existing pattern in constraints.py where _REVIEW_PHASES, _SEVERITY_TREE_PHASES, and _HANDOFF_REQUIRED_TRANSITIONS are all static frozensets.\\n\\n### 4. API Design Quality\\n\\nThe proposed interfaces are usable and consistent with the existing codebase:\\n\\n- parse_schema(path: Path) -\\u003e SchemaSpec: one input, typed output, raises SchemaParseError. Clean.\\n- get_role_context(role: RoleId) -\\u003e RoleContext: strongly-typed enum input, frozen dataclass output. Matches existing pattern (constraints.py takes RoleId, PhaseId, etc.).\\n- get_phase_context(phase: PhaseId) -\\u003e PhaseContext: same pattern.\\n- SchemaSpec fields: all typed dicts keyed by str or PhaseId/RoleId. No bare dicts of Any.\\n- RoleContext and PhaseContext: frozen dataclasses using frozenset and tuple (immutable, consistent with PhaseSpec, ConstraintSpec, HandoffSpec).\\n\\nThe API surface is minimal and directly addresses the two use cases: bootstrap extraction and runtime context injection. No unused methods. No framework creep.\\n\\n### 5. Source-of-Truth Clarity\\n\\nBootstrap → Steady-state distinction is clearly articulated:\\n- BOOTSTRAP: schema.xml → schema_parser.py → SchemaSpec → verify → expanded types.py (one-time)\\n- STEADY STATE: types.py (SoT) → gen_schema.py / gen_skills.py / context_injection.py (ongoing)\\n\\nThe integration architecture diagram makes this unambiguous. schema_parser.py's ongoing role (verification/round-trip) is cleanly separated from its bootstrap role (initial extraction). The transition point is explicit: after SLICE-1 completes and types.py is expanded, schema_parser.py becomes a verification tool rather than a migration tool.\\n\\n### 6. Vertical Slice Decomposition — Correct Granularity\\n\\n4 slices is the right count:\\n- SLICE-1: Foundation (types expansion + schema_parser). Must finish first. Cannot parallelize with anything.\\n- SLICE-2: gen_schema.py. Depends only on SLICE-1. Can parallelize with SLICE-3 and SLICE-4.\\n- SLICE-3: gen_skills.py. Depends only on SLICE-1. Can parallelize with SLICE-2 and SLICE-4.\\n- SLICE-4: context_injection.py. Depends only on SLICE-1. Can parallelize with SLICE-2 and SLICE-3.\\n\\nMerging SLICE-2+SLICE-3 would create a slice with two unrelated output formats (XML and Markdown). Merging any of SLICE-2/3/4 with SLICE-4 would conflate code generation with runtime injection — two orthogonal concerns. The 4-slice decomposition correctly follows the C-vertical-slices constraint. Each slice owns exactly one production code path.\\n\\n### 7. Existing Codebase Consistency\\n\\nVerified against types.py, constraints.py, interfaces.py:\\n\\n- Frozen dataclasses: types.py uses @dataclass(frozen=True) throughout. New types (RoleSpec, SubstepSpec, etc.) will follow the same pattern. ACCEPT.\\n- Enum-heavy approach: PhaseId, Domain, RoleId, VoteType, SeverityLevel all use class X(str, Enum). New enums ExecutionMode, ContentLevel will follow. The str subclassing enables JSON/Temporal serialization compatibility. ACCEPT.\\n- Canonical dicts: PHASE_SPECS, CONSTRAINT_SPECS, HANDOFF_SPECS use dict[PhaseId/str, XSpec] pattern. New dicts ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, etc. follow the same pattern. ACCEPT.\\n- frozenset for unordered membership, tuple for ordered sequences: PhaseSpec.owner_roles uses frozenset[RoleId]; PhaseSpec.transitions uses tuple[Transition, ...]. New types use the same discipline (RoleContext.phases uses frozenset[PhaseId]; RoleContext.commands uses tuple[str, ...]). ACCEPT.\\n- Module-level constants in ALL_CAPS: _REVIEW_PHASES, _SEVERITY_TREE_PHASES in constraints.py. Private static dicts _ROLE_CONSTRAINTS, _PHASE_CONSTRAINTS in context_injection.py follow the same underscore-prefix convention. ACCEPT.\\n\\nThe proposal's style is fully consistent with the existing codebase.\\n\\n### 8. One Observation (Not a Concern)\\n\\nThe proposal lists 8 new dataclasses: SubstepSpec, RoleSpec, DelegateSpec, CommandSpec, LabelSpec, ReviewAxisSpec, TitleConvention, ProcedureStep. SubstepSpec and DelegateSpec are new additions from the gap analysis (not in PROPOSAL-2). This is correct — the explore agents found these entity types in schema.xml. The count is accurate. Their addition is appropriate, not inflated.\\n\\n### 9. URD Coverage (Elegance Lens)\\n\\n| Req | Status | Elegance Note |\\n|-----|--------|---------------|\\n| R1 | Clean | SchemaSpec mirrors all 7 schema.xml entity types |\\n| R2 | Clean | SoT inversion clearly articulated with bootstrap/steady-state diagram |\\n| R3 | Clean | All new types are frozen dataclasses, consistent with existing |\\n| R4 | Clean | Marker-based split remains minimal and safe |\\n| R5 | Deferred (type defined, dict empty) | Correct boundary, unchanged from PROPOSAL-2 |\\n| R6 | Clean | Two-function injection, static dict, no framework |\\n| R7 | Clean | gen_schema.py → validate_schema.py round-trip |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nPROPOSAL-3 is an additive clarification of PROPOSAL-2. It resolves no new BLOCKERs (there were none) and introduces no new concerns. The gap analysis discoveries (SubstepSpec, DelegateSpec, 6 missing enums) are correct additions — they reflect what schema.xml actually contains. The integration architecture and Temporal compatibility notes reduce implementation risk without adding architectural complexity. The content_level typing fix is a correct, non-breaking improvement. All prior elegance criteria remain satisfied.\\n\\nVOTE: ACCEPT\"}","old_value":"{\"id\":\"aura-plugins-tbdc\",\"title\":\"PROPOSAL-3-REVIEW-C-1: Schema-driven v2 — Elegance\",\"description\":\"---\\nreferences:\\n  proposal: aura-plugins-mg6h\\n  urd: aura-plugins-w07o\\n  followup_urd: aura-plugins-s6i\\n---\\nReviewer C (Elegance) review of PROPOSAL-3.\",\"status\":\"open\",\"priority\":2,\"issue_type\":\"task\",\"owner\":\"dayvidpham@gmail.com\",\"created_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:26:44Z\",\"created_by\":\"David Huu Pham\",\"updated_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:26:44Z\",\"labels\":[\"aura:p4-plan:s4-review\"]}"}

Integration architecture accurately reflects existing code: workflow.py, state_machine.py, constraints.py, interfaces.py are genuinely unchanged by new type additions. Temporal compatibility confirmed: HandoffSpec is not passed to any Temporal activity and is therefore not serialized; all six Temporal-serialized types (EpochState, TransitionRecord, EpochInput, EpochResult, PhaseAdvanceSignal, ReviewVoteSignal) are unmodified. HandoffSpec.content_level str→ContentLevel change is non-breaking because ContentLevel inherits from str Enum — existing string equality assertions in test_aura_types.py and test_schema_types_sync.py remain valid. Gap analysis fidelity is high: no schema_parser.py, gen_schema.py, gen_skills.py, or context_injection.py partial implementations exist; no Jinja2 templates directory exists; no SKILL.md markers exist. Minor discrepancies found but none are blockers: (1) existing foundation table says '22 C-* validators' but actual count is 23 (stale docstring in constraints.py — schema.xml and types.py both have 23); (2) proposal says '6 missing enums' but listing includes 7 (ExecutionMode, ContentLevel, 4 Classification enums, plus ResearchDepth); (3) validate_schema.py line count 768 vs actual 767 (trivial off-by-one); (4) 'ReviewVoteEvent.axis should use axis type' gap is identified but the concrete type (a new ReviewAxis enum or Literal) is not listed in the new additions — minor implementation ambiguity resolvable during SLICE-1. AC1 through AC11 are all testable and sufficient. AC11 (Temporal Isolation) is properly scoped and verifiable by running existing workflow tests after types.py expansion.

validators)\\n2. **Integration architecture** — explicit mapping of how new v2 modules connect to existing code\\n3. **Temporal compatibility** — new types are additive only; no breaking changes to serialized types\\n4. **Modified vs new files** — clear delineation\\n5. **Gap analysis findings** — explorer-types, explorer-parser, explorer-constraints, explorer-skills results integrated\\n6. **README.md and AGENTS.md updates** — document the aura_protocol package\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Existing Foundation (v1 + followup = v0.4.3)\\n\\n### Modules (6 files in scripts/aura_protocol/)\\n| Module |

PhaseId, RoleId, VoteType, SeverityLevel)\\n- TransitionRecord (contains PhaseId)\\n- EpochInput, EpochResult, PhaseAdvanceSignal, ReviewVoteSignal\\n\\nNone of these types are modified. New types (RoleSpec, CommandSpec, etc.) are NOT used by Temporal — they're for code generation and context injection only.\\n\\n**HandoffSpec.content_level str→ContentLevel change:** This is safe because HandoffSpec is NOT serialized by Temporal. It's only used in constraints.py for validation and in types.py as a static definition. The test_schema_types_sync.py test will need updating.\\n\\n### context_injection.py Integration Points\\n\\ncontext_injection.py is a pure lookup module — no side effects, no Temporal dependency:\\n- Reads from PHASE_SPECS, CONSTRAINT_SPECS, HANDOFF_SPECS (existing), ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS (new)\\n- Called at skill invocation time (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Called at phase transition time for prompt enrichment (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Static mappings for constraint→role and constraint→phase (not in schema.xml; derived from constraint given: text)\\n- Returns frozen RoleContext / PhaseContext dataclasses\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Problem Space\\n(Preserved from PROPOSAL-2)\\n\\n**Axes:** code generation (schema → code, code → schema), drift elimination (38 SKILL.md files × 1 schema.xml), runtime context injection (role-level + phase-level), source-of-truth inversion (schema.xml → Python types.py)\\n\\n## Engineering Tradeoffs\\n(Preserved from PROPOSAL-2 + 1 addition)\\n\\n| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\\n|----------|--------|-----------|\\n| Source of truth | Python types.py | User requirement.

This revision preserves all acceptance criteria and adds:\\n\\n1. **Existing Foundation inventory** — full accounting of what v1+followup built (554 tests, 6 modules, 4 dicts, 22 C-* validators)\\n2. **Integration architecture** — explicit mapping of how new v2 modules connect to existing code\\n3. **Temporal compatibility** — new types are additive only; no breaking changes to serialized types\\n4. **Modified vs new files** — clear delineation\\n5. **Gap analysis findings** — explorer-types, explorer-parser, explorer-constraints, explorer-skills results integrated\\n6. **README.md and AGENTS.md updates** — document the aura_protocol package\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Existing Foundation (v1 + followup = v0.4.3)\\n\\n### Modules (6 files in scripts/aura_protocol/)\\n| Module | Lines | Purpose |\\n|--------|-------|---------|\\n| types.py | 682 | 5 enums, 10 frozen dataclasses, 4 canonical dicts |\\n| state_machine.py | 389 | EpochStateMachine — 12-phase lifecycle with consensus/blocker

Analysis Summary (from 4 explore agents)\\n\\n### What's genuinely new (100% greenfield)\\n- 8 new dataclasses: SubstepSpec, RoleSpec, DelegateSpec, CommandSpec, LabelSpec, ReviewAxisSpec, TitleConvention, ProcedureStep\\n- 5 new canonical dicts: ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS, REVIEW_AXIS_SPECS, TITLE_CONVENTIONS\\n- 6 missing enums from schema.xml: ExecutionMode, ContentLevel, Classification{Scope,Complexity,Risk,Novelty}, ResearchDepth\\n- schema_parser.py, gen_schema.py, gen_skills.py, context_injection.py — no partial implementations exist\\n- 0 SKILL.md markers, 0 Jinja2 templates, 0 generation scripts\\n\\n### What's reusable from v1\\n- validate_schema.py traversal patterns (~60% of schema_parser.py logic derivable)\\n- test_schema_types_sync.py field-level comparison pattern (model for AC3)\\n- SchemaFixture mutation framework (model for AC1a error-path tests)\\n- constraints.py phase-specific constants (_REVIEW_PHASES, _SEVERITY_TREE_PHASES)\\n- PHASE_SPECS.owner_roles (invertible to role→phases for context_injection.py)\\n\\n### Existing type-safety gaps to fix in this epoch\\n- HandoffSpec.content_level is bare str (should be ContentLevel

EpochState (contains PhaseId, RoleId, VoteType, SeverityLevel)\\n- TransitionRecord (contains PhaseId)\\n- EpochInput, EpochResult, PhaseAdvanceSignal, ReviewVoteSignal\\n\\nNone of these types are modified. New types (RoleSpec, CommandSpec, etc.) are NOT used by Temporal — they're for code generation and context injection only.\\n\\n**HandoffSpec.content_level str→ContentLevel change:** This is safe because HandoffSpec is NOT serialized by Temporal. It's only used in constraints.py for validation and in types.py as a static definition. The test_schema_types_sync.py test will need updating.\\n\\n### context_injection.py Integration Points\\n\\ncontext_injection.py is a pure lookup module — no side effects, no Temporal dependency:\\n- Reads from PHASE_SPECS, CONSTRAINT_SPECS, HANDOFF_SPECS (existing), ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS (new)\\n- Called at skill invocation time (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Called at phase transition time for prompt enrichment (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Static mappings for constraint→role and constraint→phase (not in schema.xml; derived from constraint given: text)\\n- Returns frozen RoleContext / PhaseContext dataclasses\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Problem Space\\n(Preserved from PROPOSAL-2)\\n\\n**Axes:** code generation (schema → code, code → schema), drift elimination (38 SKILL.md files × 1 schema.xml), runtime context injection (role-level + phase-level), source-of-truth inversion (schema.xml → Python types.py)\\n\\n## Engineering Tradeoffs\\n(Preserved from PROPOSAL-2 + 1 addition)\\n\\n| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\\n|----------|--------|-----------|\\n| Source of truth | Python types.py | User requirement. Directly usable at runtime. |\\n| Bootstrap | Auto-parse schema.xml | 1,314-line schema too large for manual transcription |\\n| Template engine | Jinja2 (dev-only dep) | Industry standard. StrictUndefined catches errors. |\\n| XML generation | xml.etree.ElementTree | Stdlib, no new dependency |\\n| SKILL.md split | Marker-based | User chose generated header + manual body |\\n| ProcedureStep | Type defined, dict empty for MVP | Deferred per Reviewer A/C feedback |\\n| content_level typing | ContentLevel enum (from str) | Type safety; non-breaking (not Temporal-serialized) |\\n| Constraint→role mapping | Static dict in context_injection.py | Not structurally encoded in schema.xml |\\n\\n## MVP Milestone\\n\\n### Architecture Overview\\n```\\n== BOOTSTRAP (one-time) ==\\nschema.xml → [schema_parser.py] → SchemaSpec → verify → expanded types.py\\n\\n== STEADY STATE (ongoing) ==\\ntypes.py (SOURCE OF TRUTH)\\n    ├─→ [gen_schema.py] → schema.xml (portable export, validated by validate_schema.py)\\n    ├─→ [gen_skills.py] → SKILL.md (generated headers with markers)\\n    └─→ [context_injection.py] → runtime role/phase context (for prompt enrichment)\\n```\\n\\n### Module 1: schema_parser.py — Bootstrap Schema Parser\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass\\nclass SchemaSpec:\\n    phases: dict[str, PhaseSpec]\\n    roles: dict[str, RoleSpec]\\n    commands: dict[str, CommandSpec]\\n    constraints: dict[str, ConstraintSpec]\\n    handoffs: dict[str, HandoffSpec]\\n    labels: dict[str, LabelSpec]\\n    review_axes: dict[str, ReviewAxisSpec]\\n    title_conventions: list[TitleConvention]\\n\\nclass SchemaParseError(Exception):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Raised when schema.xml is malformed or missing required sections.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef parse_schema(path: Path) -\\u003e SchemaSpec:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Parse schema.xml into typed Python specs.\\n    Reuses validate_schema.py traversal patterns.\\n    Raises SchemaParseError on malformed input.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 2: Expanded types.py — Protocol Types (SoT)\\n\\n**Existing types unchanged.** New additions only:\\n- New enums: ExecutionMode, ContentLevel\\n- New dataclasses: SubstepSpec, RoleSpec, DelegateSpec, CommandSpec, LabelSpec, ReviewAxisSpec, TitleConvention, ProcedureStep\\n- New canonical dicts: ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS, REVIEW_AXIS_SPECS, TITLE_CONVENTIONS\\n- Fix: HandoffSpec.content_level str → ContentLevel enum\\n- ProcedureStep: type defined, PROCEDURE_STEPS dict empty for MVP\\n\\n### Module 3: gen_schema.py — Python → schema.xml Generator\\n\\nOutput must pass existing validate_schema.py with 0 errors.

Directly usable at runtime. |\\n| Bootstrap | Hybrid codegen + manual polish (UAT-1) | gen_types.py generates draft; developer reviews and merges. Saves transcription, retains control. |\\n| Template engine | Jinja2 (dev-only dep) | Industry standard. StrictUndefined catches errors. |\\n| XML generation | xml.etree.ElementTree | Stdlib, no new dependency |\\n| SKILL.md split | Marker-based (markers required) (UAT-5) | gen_skills.py raises MarkerError if no markers found. No silent prepending. |\\n| ProcedureStep | Populated for supervisor+worker POC (UAT-6) | Proves the pattern end-to-end. Other roles deferred. |\\n| content_level typing | ContentLevel enum (from str) | Type safety; non-breaking (not Temporal-serialized) |\\n| Constraint→role mapping | Static dicts in Python → role-ref/phase-ref in XML (UAT-3) | Python is SoT; gen_schema.py exports structural attributes into schema.xml |\\n| Context injection types | ConstraintContext frozen dataclass (UAT-4) | Typed when+then fields, not bare strings. Strongly-typed throughout. |\\n| Generation diff output | gen_schema + gen_skills show diff (UAT-2) | User requirement: must see what changed on each generation run. |\\n\\n## MVP Milestone\\n\\n### Architecture Overview\\n```\\n== BOOTSTRAP (one-time) ==\\nschema.xml → [schema_parser.py] → SchemaSpec\\n         → [gen_types.py] → draft Python source\\n         → developer reviews + merges → types.py\\n\\n== STEADY STATE (ongoing) ==\\ntypes.py (SOURCE OF TRUTH)\\n    ├─→ [gen_schema.py] → schema.xml (with role-ref/phase-ref, diff shown, validated by validate_schema.py)\\n    ├─→ [gen_skills.py] → SKILL.md (generated headers with markers, diff shown)\\n    └─→ [context_injection.py] → runtime role/phase context with ConstraintContext (for prompt enrichment)\\n```\\n\\n### Module 1: schema_parser.py — Bootstrap Schema Parser\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass\\nclass SchemaSpec:\\n    phases: dict[str, PhaseSpec]\\n    roles: dict[str, RoleSpec]\\n    commands: dict[str, CommandSpec]\\n    constraints: dict[str, ConstraintSpec]\\n    handoffs: dict[str, HandoffSpec]\\n    labels: dict[str, LabelSpec]\\n    review_axes: dict[str, ReviewAxisSpec]\\n    title_conventions: list[TitleConvention]\\n\\nclass SchemaParseError(Exception):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Raised when schema.xml is malformed or missing required sections.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef parse_schema(path: Path) -\\u003e SchemaSpec:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Parse schema.xml into typed Python specs.\\n    Reuses validate_schema.py traversal patterns.\\n    Raises SchemaParseError on malformed input.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 1b: gen_types.py — Bootstrap Codegen (UAT revision 1)\\n\\n```python\\ndef generate_types_source(spec: SchemaSpec) -\\u003e str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate draft Python source code for new types/dicts from SchemaSpec.\\n    Output is a draft file for developer review and manual merge into types.py.\\n    One-time bootstrap tool; not used in steady state.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 2: Expanded types.py — Protocol Types (SoT)\\n\\n**Existing types unchanged.** New additions only:\\n- New enums: ExecutionMode, ContentLevel, ReviewAxis\\n- New dataclasses: SubstepSpec, RoleSpec, DelegateSpec, CommandSpec, LabelSpec, ReviewAxisSpec, TitleConvention, ProcedureStep, ConstraintContext\\n- New canonical dicts: ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS, REVIEW_AXIS_SPECS, TITLE_CONVENTIONS, PROCEDURE_STEPS (supervisor+worker populated)\\n- Fix: HandoffSpec.content_level str → ContentLevel enum\\n- Fix: ReviewVoteEvent.axis str → ReviewAxis enum\\n\\n### Module 3: gen_schema.py — Python → schema.xml Generator (UAT revisions 2, 3)\\n\\n```python\\ndef generate_schema(output: Path, *, diff: bool = True) -\\u003e str | None:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate schema.xml from Python types.\\n    Includes role-ref/phase-ref attributes on \\u003cconstraint\\u003e elements (UAT-3).\\n    When diff=True, prints unified diff of changes before writing (UAT-2).\\n    Output must pass existing validate_schema.py with 0 errors.\\n    Uses xml.etree.ElementTree (stdlib).\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 4: gen_skills.py — Python → SKILL.md Generator (UAT revisions 2, 5)\\n\\n```python\\nGENERATED_BEGIN = \\\"\\u003c!-- BEGIN GENERATED FROM schema --\\u003e\\\"\\nGENERATED_END = \\\"\\u003c!-- END GENERATED --\\u003e\\\"\\n\\nclass MarkerError(ValueError):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Raised when SKILL.md markers are malformed or missing.\\n    Missing markers = MarkerError (UAT-5): no silent prepending.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef generate_skill(..., diff: bool = True) -\\u003e str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate SKILL.md content.

AC1: Schema Parser Bootstrap\\nGiven schema.xml (1,314 lines) when parse_schema() is called then returns SchemaSpec with 12 phases, 5 roles, 35 commands, 23 constraints, 6 handoffs, 21 labels, 3 review axes. Should not silently skip entities.\\n\\n### AC1a: Schema Parser Error Paths\\nGiven malformed XML when parse_schema() is called then raises SchemaParseError. At least 3 error-path tests.\\n\\n### AC1b: Bootstrap Codegen (UAT revision 1)\\nGiven SchemaSpec from parse_schema() when gen_types.py runs then produces valid Python source code containing all new dataclass definitions, enum definitions, and canonical dict entries. Developer reviews draft and merges into types.py.\\n\\n### AC2: Python as Source of Truth\\nGiven types.py with expanded specs when gen_schema.py runs then produces schema.xml that passes validate_schema.py with 0 errors.\\n\\n### AC2a: Diff Output on Generation (UAT revision 2)\\nGiven types.py when gen_schema.py or gen_skills.py runs then prints unified diff of changes before writing. Developer sees exactly what changed.\\n\\n### AC2b: Constraint role-ref/phase-ref in schema.xml (UAT revision 3)\\nGiven _ROLE_CONSTRAINTS and _PHASE_CONSTRAINTS static dicts in Python when gen_schema.py runs then schema.xml constraint elements include role-ref and phase-ref attributes.\\n\\n### AC3: Round-Trip Consistency (Field-Level)\\nGiven Python types.py when generating then parsing back then every entity matches field-by-field.\\n\\n### AC4: SKILL.md Generation with Markers\\nGiven a role SKILL.md with markers when gen_skills.py runs then header updated, body preserved.\\n\\n### AC4a: SKILL.md Marker Edge Cases (UAT revision 5)\\nGiven malformed markers when gen_skills.py runs then raises MarkerError. Given SKILL.md with NO markers then raises MarkerError — no silent prepending. Should not silently discard body.\\n\\n### AC5: Role Context Injection (UAT revision 4)\\nGiven role=SUPERVISOR when get_role_context called then returns RoleContext with p7-p12 phases, ConstraintContext objects containing typed when+then fields, relevant commands.\\n\\n### AC5a: Role Context Absence\\nGiven role=SUPERVISOR then does NOT include C-worker-gates. Given role=WORKER then does NOT include C-supervisor-no-impl.\\n\\n### AC6: Phase Context Injection (UAT revision 4)\\nGiven phase=P10_CODE_REVIEW when get_phase_context called then returns PhaseContext with ConstraintContext objects containing typed when+then fields, severity constraints, review axes.\\n\\n### AC6a: Phase Context Absence\\nGiven phase=P4_REVIEW then does NOT include C-severity-eager. Given phase=P9_SLICE then does NOT include C-review-consensus.\\n\\n### AC7: No Regressions\\nAll 554 existing tests pass. No Temporal-serialized types modified.\\n\\n### AC8: Jinja2 Template Quality (Parametrized)\\nGiven each of 4 role templates when rendered with StrictUndefined then produces valid markdown.\\n\\n### AC9: Expanded Type Coverage\\nAll new spec types and dicts tested. test_schema_types_sync.py validates new dicts against schema.xml.\\n\\n### AC9a: ProcedureStep Proof of Concept (UAT revision 6)\\nGiven PROCEDURE_STEPS dict when populated for supervisor and worker roles then each role has ordered ProcedureStep entries with instruction, command, and context fields. Other roles have empty entries.\\n\\n### AC10: End-to-End Pipeline\\nparse_schema → gen_types (draft) → gen_schema (with diff) → validate_schema → gen_skills (with diff) pipeline succeeds.\\n\\n### AC11: Temporal Isolation\\nGiven expanded types.py when running Temporal workflow tests then all sandbox tests pass unchanged. No Temporal-serialized type (EpochState, TransitionRecord, EpochInput, EpochResult, PhaseAdvanceSignal, ReviewVoteSignal) is modified.\"}","old_value":"{\"id\":\"aura-plugins-mg6h\",\"title\":\"PROPOSAL-3: Schema-driven protocol engine v2 — with integration architecture and gap analysis\",\"description\":\"---\\nreferences:\\n  request: aura-plugins-w115\\n  urd: aura-plugins-w07o\\n  supersedes: aura-plugins-v01u\\n  original_urd: aura-plugins-umi\\n  original_proposal: aura-plugins-gmv\\n  followup_urd: aura-plugins-s6i\\n  v1_elicit: aura-plugins-gbr\\n  review_a_r2: aura-plugins-mu1e\\n  review_b_r2: aura-plugins-qt1p\\n  review_c_r2: aura-plugins-6hmr\\n---\\n\\n## Changes from PROPOSAL-2 (aura-plugins-v01u)\\n\\nPROPOSAL-2 achieved 3/3 ACCEPT consensus.

PhaseId, RoleId, VoteType, SeverityLevel)\\n- TransitionRecord (contains PhaseId)\\n- EpochInput, EpochResult, PhaseAdvanceSignal, ReviewVoteSignal\\n\\nNone of these types are modified. New types (RoleSpec, CommandSpec, etc.) are NOT used by Temporal — they're for code generation and context injection only.\\n\\n**HandoffSpec.content_level str→ContentLevel change:** This is safe because HandoffSpec is NOT serialized by Temporal. It's only used in constraints.py for validation and in types.py as a static definition. The test_schema_types_sync.py test will need updating.\\n\\n### context_injection.py Integration Points\\n\\ncontext_injection.py is a pure lookup module — no side effects, no Temporal dependency:\\n- Reads from PHASE_SPECS, CONSTRAINT_SPECS, HANDOFF_SPECS (existing), ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS (new)\\n- Called at skill invocation time (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Called at phase transition time for prompt enrichment (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Static mappings for constraint→role and constraint→phase (not in schema.xml; derived from constraint given: text)\\n- Returns frozen RoleContext / PhaseContext dataclasses\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Problem Space\\n(Preserved from PROPOSAL-2)\\n\\n**Axes:** code generation (schema → code, code → schema), drift elimination (38 SKILL.md files × 1 schema.xml), runtime context injection (role-level + phase-level), source-of-truth inversion (schema.xml → Python types.py)\\n\\n## Engineering Tradeoffs\\n(Preserved from PROPOSAL-2 + 1 addition)\\n\\n| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\\n|----------|--------|-----------|\\n| Source of truth | Python types.py | User requirement. Directly usable at runtime. |\\n| Bootstrap | Auto-parse schema.xml | 1,314-line schema too large for manual transcription |\\n| Template engine | Jinja2 (dev-only dep) | Industry standard.

New types (RoleSpec, CommandSpec, ConstraintContext, etc.) are NOT used by Temporal — they're for code generation and context injection only.\\n\\n**HandoffSpec.content_level str→ContentLevel change:** This is safe because HandoffSpec is NOT serialized by Temporal. It's only used in constraints.py for validation and in types.py as a static definition.\\n\\n### context_injection.py Integration Points\\n\\ncontext_injection.py is a pure lookup module — no side effects, no Temporal dependency:\\n- Reads from PHASE_SPECS, CONSTRAINT_SPECS, HANDOFF_SPECS (existing), ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS (new)\\n- Called at skill invocation time (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Called at phase transition time for prompt enrichment (not from Temporal workflow)\\n- Static mappings for constraint→role and constraint→phase (Python is SoT; gen_schema.py exports as role-ref/phase-ref into schema.xml)\\n- Returns frozen RoleContext / PhaseContext dataclasses with ConstraintContext (typed when+then)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Problem Space\\n\\n**Axes:** code generation (schema → code, code → schema), drift elimination (38 SKILL.md files × 1 schema.xml), runtime context injection (role-level + phase-level), source-of-truth inversion (schema.xml → Python types.py)\\n\\n## Engineering Tradeoffs\\n\\n| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\\n|----------|--------|-----------|\\n| Source of truth | Python types.py | User requirement. Directly usable at runtime. |\\n| Bootstrap | Hybrid codegen + manual polish (UAT-1) | gen_types.py generates draft; developer reviews and merges. Saves transcription, retains control. |\\n| Template engine | Jinja2 (dev-only dep) | Industry standard. StrictUndefined catches errors. |\\n| XML generation | xml.etree.ElementTree | Stdlib, no new dependency |\\n| SKILL.md split | Marker-based (markers required) (UAT-5) | gen_skills.py raises MarkerError if no markers found. No silent prepending. |\\n| ProcedureStep | Populated for supervisor+worker POC (UAT-6) | Proves the pattern end-to-end. Other roles deferred. |\\n| content_level typing | ContentLevel enum (from str) | Type safety; non-breaking (not Temporal-serialized) |\\n| Constraint→role mapping | Static dicts in Python → role-ref/phase-ref in XML (UAT-3) | Python is SoT; gen_schema.py exports structural attributes into schema.xml |\\n| Context injection types | ConstraintContext frozen dataclass (UAT-4) | Typed when+then fields, not bare strings. Strongly-typed throughout. |\\n| Generation diff output | gen_schema + gen_skills show diff (UAT-2) | User requirement: must see what changed on each generation run. |\\n\\n## MVP Milestone\\n\\n### Architecture Overview\\n```\\n== BOOTSTRAP (one-time) ==\\nschema.xml → [schema_parser.py] → SchemaSpec\\n         → [gen_types.py] → draft Python source\\n         → developer reviews + merges → types.py\\n\\n== STEADY STATE (ongoing) ==\\ntypes.py (SOURCE OF TRUTH)\\n    ├─→ [gen_schema.py] → schema.xml (with role-ref/phase-ref, diff shown, validated by validate_schema.py)\\n    ├─→ [gen_skills.py] → SKILL.md (generated headers with markers, diff shown)\\n    └─→ [context_injection.py] → runtime role/phase context with ConstraintContext (for prompt enrichment)\\n```\\n\\n### Module 1: schema_parser.py — Bootstrap Schema Parser\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass\\nclass SchemaSpec:\\n    phases: dict[str, PhaseSpec]\\n    roles: dict[str, RoleSpec]\\n    commands: dict[str, CommandSpec]\\n    constraints: dict[str, ConstraintSpec]\\n    handoffs: dict[str, HandoffSpec]\\n    labels: dict[str, LabelSpec]\\n    review_axes: dict[str, ReviewAxisSpec]\\n    title_conventions: list[TitleConvention]\\n\\nclass SchemaParseError(Exception):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Raised when schema.xml is malformed or missing required sections.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef parse_schema(path: Path) -\\u003e SchemaSpec:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Parse schema.xml into typed Python specs.\\n    Reuses validate_schema.py traversal patterns.\\n    Raises SchemaParseError on malformed input.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 1b: gen_types.py — Bootstrap Codegen (UAT revision 1)\\n\\n```python\\ndef generate_types_source(spec: SchemaSpec) -\\u003e str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate draft Python source code for new types/dicts from SchemaSpec.\\n    Output is a draft file for developer review and manual merge into types.py.\\n    One-time bootstrap tool; not used in steady state.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 2: Expanded types.py — Protocol Types (SoT)\\n\\n**Existing types unchanged.** New additions only:\\n- New enums: ExecutionMode, ContentLevel, ReviewAxis\\n- New dataclasses: SubstepSpec, RoleSpec, DelegateSpec, CommandSpec, LabelSpec, ReviewAxisSpec, TitleConvention, ProcedureStep, ConstraintContext\\n- New canonical dicts: ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS, REVIEW_AXIS_SPECS, TITLE_CONVENTIONS, PROCEDURE_STEPS (supervisor+worker populated)\\n- Fix: HandoffSpec.content_level str → ContentLevel enum\\n- Fix: ReviewVoteEvent.axis str → ReviewAxis enum\\n\\n### Module 3: gen_schema.py — Python → schema.xml Generator (UAT revisions 2, 3)\\n\\n```python\\ndef generate_schema(output: Path, *, diff: bool = True) -\\u003e str | None:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate schema.xml from Python types.\\n    Includes role-ref/phase-ref attributes on \\u003cconstraint\\u003e elements (UAT-3).\\n    When diff=True, prints unified diff of changes before writing (UAT-2).\\n    Output must pass existing validate_schema.py with 0 errors.\\n    Uses xml.etree.ElementTree (stdlib).\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 4: gen_skills.py — Python → SKILL.md Generator (UAT revisions 2, 5)\\n\\n```python\\nGENERATED_BEGIN = \\\"\\u003c!-- BEGIN GENERATED FROM schema --\\u003e\\\"\\nGENERATED_END = \\\"\\u003c!-- END GENERATED --\\u003e\\\"\\n\\nclass MarkerError(ValueError):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Raised when SKILL.md markers are malformed or missing.\\n    Missing markers = MarkerError (UAT-5): no silent prepending.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef generate_skill(..., diff: bool = True) -\\u003e str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate SKILL.md content.

AC1: Schema Parser Bootstrap\\nGiven schema.xml (1,314 lines) when parse_schema() is called then returns SchemaSpec with 12 phases, 5 roles, 35 commands, 23 constraints, 6 handoffs, 21 labels, 3 review axes. Should not silently skip entities.\\n\\n### AC1a: Schema Parser Error Paths\\nGiven malformed XML when parse_schema() is called then raises SchemaParseError. At least 3 error-path tests.\\n\\n### AC1b: Bootstrap Codegen (UAT revision 1)\\nGiven SchemaSpec from parse_schema() when gen_types.py runs then produces valid Python source code containing all new dataclass definitions, enum definitions, and canonical dict entries. Developer reviews draft and merges into types.py.\\n\\n### AC2: Python as Source of Truth\\nGiven types.py with expanded specs when gen_schema.py runs then produces schema.xml that passes validate_schema.py with 0 errors.\\n\\n### AC2a: Diff Output on Generation (UAT revision 2)\\nGiven types.py when gen_schema.py or gen_skills.py runs then prints unified diff of changes before writing. Developer sees exactly what changed.\\n\\n### AC2b: Constraint role-ref/phase-ref in schema.xml (UAT revision 3)\\nGiven _ROLE_CONSTRAINTS and _PHASE_CONSTRAINTS static dicts in Python when gen_schema.py runs then schema.xml constraint elements include role-ref and phase-ref attributes.\\n\\n### AC3: Round-Trip Consistency (Field-Level)\\nGiven Python types.py when generating then parsing back then every entity matches field-by-field.\\n\\n### AC4: SKILL.md Generation with Markers\\nGiven a role SKILL.md with markers when gen_skills.py runs then header updated, body preserved.\\n\\n### AC4a: SKILL.md Marker Edge Cases (UAT revision 5)\\nGiven malformed markers when gen_skills.py runs then raises MarkerError.

Directly usable at runtime. |\\n| Bootstrap | Hybrid codegen + manual polish (UAT-1) | gen_types.py generates draft; developer reviews and merges. Saves transcription, retains control. |\\n| Template engine | Jinja2 (dev-only dep) | Industry standard. StrictUndefined catches errors. |\\n| XML generation | xml.etree.ElementTree | Stdlib, no new dependency |\\n| SKILL.md split | Marker-based (markers required) (UAT-5) | gen_skills.py raises MarkerError if no markers found. No silent prepending. |\\n| ProcedureStep | Populated for supervisor+worker POC (UAT-6) | Proves the pattern end-to-end. Other roles deferred. |\\n| content_level typing | ContentLevel enum (from str) | Type safety; non-breaking (not Temporal-serialized) |\\n| Constraint→role mapping | Static dicts in Python → role-ref/phase-ref in XML (UAT-3) | Python is SoT; gen_schema.py exports structural attributes into schema.xml |\\n| Context injection types | ConstraintContext frozen dataclass (UAT-4) | Typed when+then fields, not bare strings. Strongly-typed throughout. |\\n| Generation diff output | gen_schema + gen_skills show diff (UAT-2) | User requirement: must see what changed on each generation run. |\\n\\n## MVP Milestone\\n\\n### Architecture Overview\\n```\\n== BOOTSTRAP (one-time) ==\\nschema.xml → [schema_parser.py] → SchemaSpec\\n         → [gen_types.py] → draft Python source\\n         → developer reviews + merges → types.py\\n\\n== STEADY STATE (ongoing) ==\\ntypes.py (SOURCE OF TRUTH)\\n    ├─→ [gen_schema.py] → schema.xml (with role-ref/phase-ref, diff shown, validated by validate_schema.py)\\n    ├─→ [gen_skills.py] → SKILL.md (generated headers with markers, diff shown)\\n    └─→ [context_injection.py] → runtime role/phase context with ConstraintContext (for prompt enrichment)\\n```\\n\\n### Module 1: schema_parser.py — Bootstrap Schema Parser\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass\\nclass SchemaSpec:\\n    phases: dict[str, PhaseSpec]\\n    roles: dict[str, RoleSpec]\\n    commands: dict[str, CommandSpec]\\n    constraints: dict[str, ConstraintSpec]\\n    handoffs: dict[str, HandoffSpec]\\n    labels: dict[str, LabelSpec]\\n    review_axes: dict[str, ReviewAxisSpec]\\n    title_conventions: list[TitleConvention]\\n\\nclass SchemaParseError(Exception):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Raised when schema.xml is malformed or missing required sections.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef parse_schema(path: Path) -\\u003e SchemaSpec:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Parse schema.xml into typed Python specs.\\n    Reuses validate_schema.py traversal patterns.\\n    Raises SchemaParseError on malformed input.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 1b: gen_types.py — Bootstrap Codegen (UAT revision 1)\\n\\n```python\\ndef generate_types_source(spec: SchemaSpec) -\\u003e str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate draft Python source code for new types/dicts from SchemaSpec.\\n    Output is a draft file for developer review and manual merge into types.py.\\n    One-time bootstrap tool; not used in steady state.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 2: Expanded types.py — Protocol Types (SoT)\\n\\n**Existing types unchanged.** New additions only:\\n- New enums: ExecutionMode, ContentLevel, ReviewAxis\\n- New dataclasses: SubstepSpec, RoleSpec, DelegateSpec, CommandSpec, LabelSpec, ReviewAxisSpec, TitleConvention, ProcedureStep, ConstraintContext\\n- New canonical dicts: ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, LABEL_SPECS, REVIEW_AXIS_SPECS, TITLE_CONVENTIONS, PROCEDURE_STEPS (supervisor+worker populated)\\n- Fix: HandoffSpec.content_level str → ContentLevel enum\\n- Fix: ReviewVoteEvent.axis str → ReviewAxis enum\\n\\n### Module 3: gen_schema.py — Python → schema.xml Generator (UAT revisions 2, 3)\\n\\n```python\\ndef generate_schema(output: Path, *, diff: bool = True) -\\u003e str | None:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate schema.xml from Python types.\\n    Includes role-ref/phase-ref attributes on \\u003cconstraint\\u003e elements (UAT-3).\\n    When diff=True, prints unified diff of changes before writing (UAT-2).\\n    Output must pass existing validate_schema.py with 0 errors.\\n    Uses xml.etree.ElementTree (stdlib).\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Module 4: gen_skills.py — Python → SKILL.md Generator (UAT revisions 2, 5)\\n\\n```python\\nGENERATED_BEGIN = \\\"\\u003c!-- BEGIN GENERATED FROM schema --\\u003e\\\"\\nGENERATED_END = \\\"\\u003c!-- END GENERATED --\\u003e\\\"\\n\\nclass MarkerError(ValueError):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Raised when SKILL.md markers are malformed or missing.\\n    Missing markers = MarkerError (UAT-5): no silent prepending.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef generate_skill(..., diff: bool = True) -\\u003e str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Generate SKILL.md content.

Integration architecture accurately reflects existing code: workflow.py, state_machine.py, constraints.py, interfaces.py are genuinely unchanged by new type additions.

All 7 review focus areas are satisfied.\\n\\n## Review Summary (Axis B — Test Quality)\\n\\n### 1. Test Strategy Sufficiency\\n\\nThe 4 new test files (test_schema_parser.py, test_gen_schema.py, test_gen_skills.py, test_context_injection.py) plus extensions to test_schema_types_sync.py provide complete coverage mapped to all new modules. Each new module has a dedicated test file. The mapping is 1:1 with module boundaries (schema_parser ↔ test_schema_parser, gen_schema ↔ test_gen_schema, gen_skills ↔ test_gen_skills, context_injection ↔ test_context_injection). This aligns with the existing pattern (constraints.py ↔ test_constraints.py, state_machine.py ↔ test_state_machine.py). No module is untested.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE.\\n\\n### 2. Error Path Coverage\\n\\nAC1a specifies 3+ error-path tests for SchemaParseError with named failure inputs: malformed XML (truncated), missing required sections (e.g. `\\u003cphases\\u003e`), and missing required attributes. SchemaParseError is defined as a proper exception class with a clear docstring. The validation checklist has a dedicated entry.\\n\\nAC4a specifies three distinct marker edge cases for MarkerError: (1) missing END marker → raise, (2) missing both markers → generate full content (clean path), (3) reversed markers → raise. The \\\"should not silently discard body on any boundary error\\\" invariant is the correct safety clause. MarkerError is defined as a ValueError subclass.\\n\\nTogether these are 6+ named error scenarios across 2 error types. The mutation-based approach from test_validate_schema.py provides a strong conceptual model that test_schema_parser.py can follow (inject bad inputs, assert specific exception with correct type).\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE.\\n\\n### 3. Round-Trip Test Design\\n\\nAC3 specifies \\\"field-by-field comparison\\\" and the validation checklist says \\\"(not count-only)\\\". The existing test_schema_types_sync.py at lines 294-308 (TestConstraintSpecsMatchSchema.test_constraint_given_when_then_match_schema) already demonstrates the correct pattern: iterate schema elements, look up the Python spec by ID, and assert each field individually (given, when, then). This is the exact model for AC3.\\n\\nThe proposal names specific fields per entity type in AC3: ConstraintSpec.given/when/then/should_not, HandoffSpec.required_fields, SubstepSpec.startup_sequence. These are concrete anchors that prevent count-only assertions. The test_gen_schema round-trip direction is: types.py → gen_schema → parse_schema → field-level comparison, which is a true integration test of two new modules working together. The prior Round 2 review B (aura-plugins-qt1p) correctly identified that AC3 should cover should_not (missing from the existing test_schema_types_sync.py pattern) — and the proposal now includes it explicitly.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE. The model is demonstrated in the existing codebase and the proposal correctly extends it.\\n\\n### 4. Absence Testing\\n\\nAC5a names concrete constraint IDs: C-worker-gates must NOT appear in get_role_context(SUPERVISOR); C-supervisor-no-impl must NOT appear in get_role_context(WORKER). AC6a: C-severity-eager must NOT appear in get_phase_context(P4_REVIEW); C-review-consensus must NOT appear in get_phase_context(P9_SLICE).\\n\\nThese are precise, falsifiable assertions against specific string identifiers. They test the SUT's output (the returned frozenset), not internal state. They follow the project's convention of asserting observable outcomes. The validation checklist has two dedicated entries (\\\"get_role_context does NOT include irrelevant constraints\\\", \\\"get_phase_context does NOT include irrelevant constraints\\\").\\n\\nOne observation: these absence tests rely on the static _ROLE_CONSTRAINTS and _PHASE_CONSTRAINTS dicts in context_injection.py being correctly populated. Since these dicts are hand-authored (not derived from schema.xml structurally), the tests need to be robust enough that they catch errors in that hand-authored data. The named constraint IDs (C-worker-gates, C-supervisor-no-impl) provide exactly the right anchors.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE.\\n\\n### 5. Regression Safety\\n\\nAC7 states \\\"all 554 existing tests pass\\\" and AC11 (Temporal Isolation) states \\\"all sandbox tests pass unchanged\\\" with an explicit enumeration of the 6 Temporal-serialized types that must NOT be modified (EpochState, TransitionRecord, EpochInput, EpochResult, PhaseAdvanceSignal, ReviewVoteSignal). The \\\"unchanged\\\" files list explicitly includes state_machine.py, constraints.py, workflow.py, interfaces.py — all of which have comprehensive existing tests (test_state_machine.py ~120, test_constraints.py ~180, test_workflow.py ~60, test_interfaces.py ~40).\\n\\nThe HandoffSpec.content_level str→ContentLevel change (the one non-additive modification) is correctly called out in the proposal as requiring test_schema_types_sync.py to update (line 346 comparison `spec.content_level == h.get(\\\"content-level\\\")` will need to compare the enum value string, not the enum itself).\\n\\nOne specific gap: the proposal does not explicitly call out that test_schema_types_sync.py's TestHandoffSpecsMatchSchema.test_handoff_roles_match_schema will need updating for the content_level field after the str→ContentLevel change. This is a valid implementation concern but it is traceable from the validation checklist (\\\"test_schema_types_sync.py covers all new canonical dicts\\\") and the \\\"modified files\\\" table (test_schema_types_sync.py listed as modified). A worker reading both sections can connect the dots.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE. The regression strategy is sound. The one gap (content_level comparison update) is traceable from proposal text.\\n\\n### 6. Integration Test Coverage\\n\\nAC10 specifies the end-to-end pipeline test: parse_schema → populate types → gen_schema → validate_schema → gen_skills. This exercises all 4 new modules in sequence plus the existing validate_schema.py. This is a true integration test — not a mock-based test — because it runs the actual parsing, generation, and validation logic. It follows the project's convention (test_validate_schema.py already tests validate_schema.py via both the library API and subprocess CLI).\\n\\nThe prior Round 2 Review B (aura-plugins-qt1p) noted the \\\"pipeline direction ambiguity\\\" in AC10 (bootstrap vs. steady-state) as an IMPORTANT finding. PROPOSAL-3 does not resolve this ambiguity — AC10 still reads \\\"parse_schema → populate types → gen_schema → validate_schema → gen_skills\\\" which mixes bootstrap (schema→Python) and steady-state (Python→schema) steps. The validation checklist uses the slightly different phrasing \\\"parse → gen_schema → validate → gen_skills\\\" which omits \\\"populate types\\\".\\n\\nThis is the same IMPORTANT finding from Round 2 — not a new BLOCKER. Workers can resolve it by reading both documents together, and the checklist phrasing is the more actionable guide. Both pipeline directions are valid to test.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE for a plan-review vote. The ambiguity is pre-existing, documented, and not a blocker.\\n\\n### 7. Existing Test Pattern Alignment\\n\\nReading conftest.py and test_schema_types_sync.py reveals the following conventions:\\n- Class-per-concern grouping (TestPhaseIdMatchesSchema, TestConstraintSpecsMatchSchema, etc.)\\n- Module-scoped fixtures for expensive resources (schema_root fixture with scope=\\\"module\\\")\\n- Field-level assertions with informative error messages (f-string showing both sides)\\n- pytest.mark.parametrize for combinatorial coverage (mutation tests, template rendering across 4 roles)\\n- from __future__ import annotations at the top\\n- Absolute Path construction via Path(__file__).resolve().parent\\n\\nThe proposal's test design aligns well with these conventions:\\n- AC8 uses pytest.mark.parametrize over 4 role templates (aligns with TestMutationDetection pattern)\\n- AC3 round-trip uses field-level assertions (aligns with test_constraint_given_when_then_match_schema pattern)\\n- test_schema_parser.py error paths can use SchemaFixture-style mutation injection\\n- The module-scoped schema_root fixture from test_schema_types_sync.py should be shared or replicated in test_gen_schema.py — the proposal does not explicitly specify this, but it is implied by the existing pattern\\n\\nOne alignment gap: the proposal does not specify whether the new test files should use module-scoped fixtures for the parse_schema() call (expensive XML parse). This is a minor implementation detail the worker should follow from convention, not a plan-level concern.\\n\\nASSESSMENT: ADEQUATE. Proposal aligns with existing conventions.\\n\\n## Verdict\\n\\nAll 7 review focus areas are satisfied. The test strategy is comprehensive, well-anchored in named failure inputs and named constraint IDs, field-level comparison is modelled on existing code, regression safety is explicitly scoped, and integration coverage exercises all 4 new modules end-to-end. No new blockers identified beyond the pre-existing AC10 direction ambiguity (already documented in prior Round 2 review as IMPORTANT, not BLOCKER).\\n\\nVOTE: ACCEPT\",\"status\":\"open\",\"priority\":2,\"issue_type\":\"task\",\"owner\":\"dayvidpham@gmail.com\",\"created_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:26:44Z\",\"created_by\":\"David Huu Pham\",\"updated_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:29:01Z\",\"labels\":[\"aura:p4-plan:s4-review\"]}"}

Existing Foundation inventory (full v1+followup accounting)\\n2. Integration architecture diagram (explicit module-to-existing-code mapping)\\n3. Temporal compatibility analysis (no breaking changes to serialized types)\\n4. Modified vs new files delineation (clear ownership per file)\\n5. Gap analysis findings from 4 explore agents (SubstepSpec, DelegateSpec, 6 missing enums)\\n6. AC11: Temporal Isolation (new, explicit, machine-verifiable AC)\\n7. content_level str→ContentLevel enum fix (non-breaking type-safety improvement)\\n\\nNone of these additions introduce new modules, new abstractions, or new complexity. They are documentation improvements and a minor type-safety fix. The underlying architecture is unchanged.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Sub-Axis Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Complexity Proportionality\\n\\nThe added elements are proportionate:\\n- Gap analysis → 2 additional dataclasses (SubstepSpec, DelegateSpec) and 6 missing enums found by explore agents. These are discoveries, not invented complexity. Schema.xml has these entities; the types should represent them.\\n- AC11 (Temporal Isolation) is a zero-implementation-cost AC — the existing Temporal types are unchanged; the test just verifies the sandbox tests still pass. This is pure guard rail.\\n- content_level enum change: one field type corrected. Non-breaking because HandoffSpec is not Temporal-serialized. The proposal documents this reasoning explicitly.\\n\\n### 2. Module Decomposition — Unchanged, Still Clean\\n\\n4 new modules: schema_parser, gen_schema, gen_skills, context_injection. Each has single responsibility. Dependency graph remains a tree: generators and context_injection import types.py only, never each other. No circular dependencies possible. The integration architecture diagram confirms this explicitly.\\n\\n### 3. context_injection.py Static Dict Approach — Adequate\\n\\nThe static dict approach for constraint→role and constraint→phase mappings is justified: the proposal correctly notes that this mapping is NOT structurally encoded in schema.xml (it's in the 'given:' text of constraints). The two options are (a) static dict or (b) parse free-text given: clauses at runtime. Option (b) would add fragility (free-text parsing) for no gain. Option (a) is correct. The approach matches the existing pattern in constraints.py where _REVIEW_PHASES, _SEVERITY_TREE_PHASES, and _HANDOFF_REQUIRED_TRANSITIONS are all static frozensets.\\n\\n### 4. API Design Quality\\n\\nThe proposed interfaces are usable and consistent with the existing codebase:\\n\\n- parse_schema(path: Path) -\\u003e SchemaSpec: one input, typed output, raises SchemaParseError. Clean.\\n- get_role_context(role: RoleId) -\\u003e RoleContext: strongly-typed enum input, frozen dataclass output. Matches existing pattern (constraints.py takes RoleId, PhaseId, etc.).\\n- get_phase_context(phase: PhaseId) -\\u003e PhaseContext: same pattern.\\n- SchemaSpec fields: all typed dicts keyed by str or PhaseId/RoleId. No bare dicts of Any.\\n- RoleContext and PhaseContext: frozen dataclasses using frozenset and tuple (immutable, consistent with PhaseSpec, ConstraintSpec, HandoffSpec).\\n\\nThe API surface is minimal and directly addresses the two use cases: bootstrap extraction and runtime context injection. No unused methods. No framework creep.\\n\\n### 5. Source-of-Truth Clarity\\n\\nBootstrap → Steady-state distinction is clearly articulated:\\n- BOOTSTRAP: schema.xml → schema_parser.py → SchemaSpec → verify → expanded types.py (one-time)\\n- STEADY STATE: types.py (SoT) → gen_schema.py / gen_skills.py / context_injection.py (ongoing)\\n\\nThe integration architecture diagram makes this unambiguous. schema_parser.py's ongoing role (verification/round-trip) is cleanly separated from its bootstrap role (initial extraction). The transition point is explicit: after SLICE-1 completes and types.py is expanded, schema_parser.py becomes a verification tool rather than a migration tool.\\n\\n### 6. Vertical Slice Decomposition — Correct Granularity\\n\\n4 slices is the right count:\\n- SLICE-1: Foundation (types expansion + schema_parser). Must finish first. Cannot parallelize with anything.\\n- SLICE-2: gen_schema.py. Depends only on SLICE-1. Can parallelize with SLICE-3 and SLICE-4.\\n- SLICE-3: gen_skills.py. Depends only on SLICE-1. Can parallelize with SLICE-2 and SLICE-4.\\n- SLICE-4: context_injection.py. Depends only on SLICE-1. Can parallelize with SLICE-2 and SLICE-3.\\n\\nMerging SLICE-2+SLICE-3 would create a slice with two unrelated output formats (XML and Markdown). Merging any of SLICE-2/3/4 with SLICE-4 would conflate code generation with runtime injection — two orthogonal concerns. The 4-slice decomposition correctly follows the C-vertical-slices constraint. Each slice owns exactly one production code path.\\n\\n### 7. Existing Codebase Consistency\\n\\nVerified against types.py, constraints.py, interfaces.py:\\n\\n- Frozen dataclasses: types.py uses @dataclass(frozen=True) throughout. New types (RoleSpec, SubstepSpec, etc.) will follow the same pattern. ACCEPT.\\n- Enum-heavy approach: PhaseId, Domain, RoleId, VoteType, SeverityLevel all use class X(str, Enum). New enums ExecutionMode, ContentLevel will follow. The str subclassing enables JSON/Temporal serialization compatibility. ACCEPT.\\n- Canonical dicts: PHASE_SPECS, CONSTRAINT_SPECS, HANDOFF_SPECS use dict[PhaseId/str, XSpec] pattern. New dicts ROLE_SPECS, COMMAND_SPECS, etc. follow the same pattern. ACCEPT.\\n- frozenset for unordered membership, tuple for ordered sequences: PhaseSpec.owner_roles uses frozenset[RoleId]; PhaseSpec.transitions uses tuple[Transition, ...]. New types use the same discipline (RoleContext.phases uses frozenset[PhaseId]; RoleContext.commands uses tuple[str, ...]). ACCEPT.\\n- Module-level constants in ALL_CAPS: _REVIEW_PHASES, _SEVERITY_TREE_PHASES in constraints.py. Private static dicts _ROLE_CONSTRAINTS, _PHASE_CONSTRAINTS in context_injection.py follow the same underscore-prefix convention. ACCEPT.\\n\\nThe proposal's style is fully consistent with the existing codebase.\\n\\n### 8. One Observation (Not a Concern)\\n\\nThe proposal lists 8 new dataclasses: SubstepSpec, RoleSpec, DelegateSpec, CommandSpec, LabelSpec, ReviewAxisSpec, TitleConvention, ProcedureStep. SubstepSpec and DelegateSpec are new additions from the gap analysis (not in PROPOSAL-2). This is correct — the explore agents found these entity types in schema.xml. The count is accurate. Their addition is appropriate, not inflated.\\n\\n### 9. URD Coverage (Elegance Lens)\\n\\n| Req | Status | Elegance Note |\\n|-----|--------|---------------|\\n| R1 | Clean | SchemaSpec mirrors all 7 schema.xml entity types |\\n| R2 | Clean | SoT inversion clearly articulated with bootstrap/steady-state diagram |\\n| R3 | Clean | All new types are frozen dataclasses, consistent with existing |\\n| R4 | Clean | Marker-based split remains minimal and safe |\\n| R5 | Deferred (type defined, dict empty) | Correct boundary, unchanged from PROPOSAL-2 |\\n| R6 | Clean | Two-function injection, static dict, no framework |\\n| R7 | Clean | gen_schema.py → validate_schema.py round-trip |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nPROPOSAL-3 is an additive clarification of PROPOSAL-2. It resolves no new BLOCKERs (there were none) and introduces no new concerns. The gap analysis discoveries (SubstepSpec, DelegateSpec, 6 missing enums) are correct additions — they reflect what schema.xml actually contains. The integration architecture and Temporal compatibility notes reduce implementation risk without adding architectural complexity. The content_level typing fix is a correct, non-breaking improvement. All prior elegance criteria remain satisfied.\\n\\nVOTE: ACCEPT\",\"status\":\"open\",\"priority\":2,\"issue_type\":\"task\",\"owner\":\"dayvidpham@gmail.com\",\"created_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:26:44Z\",\"created_by\":\"David Huu Pham\",\"updated_at\":\"2026-02-22T23:29:03Z\",\"labels\":[\"aura:p4-plan:s4-review\"]}"}

The alternative is a codegen script that generates the actual types.py source code. Which approach for seeding the initial types.py?\\n**Options presented:**\\n- Manual transcription from SchemaSpec\\n- Codegen script writes types.py\\n- Hybrid: codegen draft + manual polish\\n**User response:** Hybrid: codegen draft + manual polish\\n\\n**Question asked:** Any feedback on the steady-state workflow (edit types.py → gen_schema → validate → gen_skills)?\\n**User response:** \\\"The generate and validate: must include a diff showing what changed.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Component 2: Constraint→Role/Phase Mapping\\n\\n**Definition shown:**\\n```python\\n_ROLE_CONSTRAINTS: dict[RoleId, frozenset[str]] = {\\n    RoleId.SUPERVISOR: frozenset({\\\"C-supervisor-no-impl\\\", ...}),\\n    ...\\n}\\n```\\nPlus example XML showing free-text given: clauses.\\n\\n**Question asked:** The constraint→role and constraint→phase mappings must be hand-authored because schema.xml only has free-text given: clauses. Three options for where these mappings live:\\n**Options presented:**\\n- Static dicts in context_injection.py\\n- Add role-ref/phase-ref to schema.xml\\n- Derive from ConstraintSpec.given text\\n**User response:** \\\"(1) and (2). The Python code should generate the schema.xml.\\\"\\n\\n**Question asked:** Any feedback on the RoleContext/PhaseContext API shape?\\n**User response:** \\\"How are the when elements being captured?\\\"\\n\\n**Follow-up question asked:** The when: clause tells agents WHEN a constraint activates. Currently PhaseContext only includes constraint IDs. Should the when: text be surfaced in the context injection output?\\n**Options presented:**\\n- Include full Given/When/Then in context\\n- IDs only — agents look up full text themselves\\n- Include when+then only (compact)\\n**User response:** Include when+then only (compact)\\n**User clarification:** \\\"Should be strongly typed enums, not strings\\\"\\n\\n**Revised design:**\\n```python\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass ConstraintContext:\\n    id: str\\n    when: str\\n    then: str\\n\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass PhaseContext:\\n    phase: PhaseId\\n    constraints: frozenset[ConstraintContext]  # typed, not frozenset[str]\\n    labels: tuple[str, ...]\\n    transitions: tuple[Transition, ...]\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Component 3: SKILL.md Marker Strategy\\n\\n**Definition shown:** Before/after of SKILL.md with BEGIN/END markers.\\n\\n**Question asked:** First run of gen_skills.py on 38 existing SKILL.md files with no markers. What should happen?\\n**Options presented:**\\n- Prepend generated header + add markers\\n- Require manual marker placement first\\n- Interactive: show diff, ask per file\\n**User response:** Require manual marker placement first\\n\\n**Question asked:** Any feedback on the marker format or SKILL.md structure?\\n**User response:** No additional feedback\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Component 4: ProcedureStep Deferral\\n\\n**Definition shown:**\\n```python\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass ProcedureStep:\\n    order: int\\n    instruction: str\\n    command: str | None\\n    context: str | None\\n\\nPROCEDURE_STEPS: dict[PhaseId, tuple[ProcedureStep, ...]] = {}  # empty for MVP\\n```\\n\\n**Question asked:** ProcedureStep type defined but dict empty for MVP. Is this deferral acceptable?\\n**Options presented:**\\n- Accept deferral\\n- Populate 1-2 roles as proof of concept\\n- Must populate all for MVP\\n**User response:** Populate 1-2 roles as proof of concept\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final Decision\\nACCEPT with 6 revisions:\\n1. Bootstrap: Hybrid codegen draft (gen_types.py) + manual polish\\n2. Steady-state: gen_schema/gen_skills must show diff of what changed\\n3. Constraint→role mapping: Static dicts in Python + generate role-ref/phase-ref into schema.xml\\n4. When clause: ConstraintContext frozen dataclass with typed when+then (no bare strings)\\n5.

Function-scope autouse ONLY clears repo_root lru_cache — it does NOT pop sys.modules. Teardown is handled by the module-scope fixture after all tests.\\n\\n### New test case E\\n\\n```python\\ndef test_case_e_root_pyproject_without_version_key(\\n    self, tmp_path: Path, aura_release_mod\\n) -\\u003e None:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Root-level pyproject.toml with only [tool.*] section is excluded.\\n\\n    Guards the _has_pyproject_version() filter at root level (lines 264-266),\\n    which is distinct from the subdir path tested in test_case_d.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    (tmp_path / \\\"pyproject.toml\\\").write_text(_TOOL_ONLY_PYPROJECT)\\n    results = aura_release_mod.discover_version_files(tmp_path)\\n    assert results == []\\n```\\n\\nAll existing test methods (A-D) updated to accept `aura_release_mod` parameter.\\n\\n### Update TestDiscoverVersionFiles docstring\\n\\n```python\\nclass TestDiscoverVersionFiles:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"discover_version_files() driven by _SCAN_SPECS.\\n\\n    Covers pyproject.toml discovery only (package.json / plugin.json /\\n    marketplace.json are out of scope for this class — see TestVersionFileWrites).\\n    Root and subdirectory paths are exercised; version-key filter is verified\\n    at both levels.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## SLICE-2: Fix MarketplaceVersionFile.write() + test\\n\\n### Code fix\\n\\n```python\\ndef write(self, version: str, *, dry_run: bool = False) -\\u003e None:\\n    data = json.loads(self.path.read_text(encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"))\\n    data[\\\"metadata\\\"][\\\"version\\\"] = version\\n    # plugins[*].version intentionally NOT updated — each plugin manages its own version\\n    if not dry_run:\\n        self.path.write_text(json.dumps(data, indent=2) + \\\"\\\\n\\\", encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### New test class: TestVersionFileWrites\\n\\n```python\\nclass TestVersionFileWrites:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"write() behaviour for VersionFile subclasses.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    def test_marketplace_write_updates_only_metadata_version(\\n        self, tmp_path: Path, aura_release_mod\\n    ) -\\u003e None:\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"write() bumps metadata.version only; plugins[*].version unchanged.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        marketplace = {\\n            \\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\"},\\n            \\\"plugins\\\": [\\n                {\\\"name\\\": \\\"aura\\\", \\\"version\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\"},\\n                {\\\"name\\\": \\\"agentfilter\\\", \\\"version\\\": \\\"0.3.0\\\"},\\n            ],\\n        }\\n        mp = tmp_path / \\\"marketplace.json\\\"\\n        mp.write_text(json.dumps(marketplace, indent=2) + \\\"\\\\n\\\", encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\")\\n\\n        mod = aura_release_mod\\n        vf = mod.MarketplaceVersionFile(name=\\\"marketplace.json\\\", path=mp)\\n        vf.write(\\\"1.0.1\\\")\\n\\n        data = json.loads(mp.read_text(encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"))\\n        assert data[\\\"metadata\\\"][\\\"version\\\"] == \\\"1.0.1\\\"        # bumped\\n        assert data[\\\"plugins\\\"][0][\\\"version\\\"] == \\\"1.0.0\\\"      # unchanged (aura)\\n        assert data[\\\"plugins\\\"][1][\\\"version\\\"] == \\\"0.3.0\\\"      # unchanged (agentfilter)\\n\\n    def test_marketplace_write_dry_run_does_not_write(\\n        self, tmp_path: Path, aura_release_mod\\n    ) -\\u003e None:\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"write(dry_run=True) must not modify the file.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n        marketplace = {\\\"metadata\\\": {\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\"}, \\\"plugins\\\": []}\\n        mp = tmp_path / \\\"marketplace.json\\\"\\n        mp.write_text(json.dumps(marketplace, indent=2) + \\\"\\\\n\\\", encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\")\\n\\n        mod = aura_release_mod\\n        vf = mod.MarketplaceVersionFile(name=\\\"marketplace.json\\\", path=mp)\\n        vf.write(\\\"1.0.1\\\", dry_run=True)\\n\\n        data = json.loads(mp.read_text(encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"))\\n        assert data[\\\"metadata\\\"][\\\"version\\\"] == \\\"1.0.0\\\"  # unchanged\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## SLICE-3: Registry types, lazy path, loading (bin/aura-release)\\n\\n### Lazy path function (replaces eager constant)\\n\\n```python\\ndef _registry_path() -\\u003e Path:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return the user-global plugin registry path.

Executive Summary\\n\\nComplete re-scope from PROPOSAL-5. ACP alignment (R13, R15-R17) deferred to a dedicated aura-acp plugin epic. v3 core scope is R1-R12 only.\\n\\n**Why:** Claude Code lacks native ACP support. All harnesses need their own adapters (Claude Code via Agent SDK; Gemini/OpenCode/Codex via ACP adapter). Coupling the core to the ACP SDK produces a leaky abstraction. Harness-agnostic core + harness plugin is the correct long-term design.\\n\\n**What changes:** Remove all ACP-specific types from core: no AcpRawSignal, AcpMappedSignal, AuraSignalType, AcpEventMapper, map_acp_event activity, AcpTranscriptRecorder, AcpSecurityGate, acp_session_update signal. No agent-client-protocol or pydantic dependency.\\n\\n**What stays:** All of R1-R12 plus R14 (ToolCall camelCase JSON aliases — naming only, no SDK).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2.

Addresses A-1 and B-1 MUST FIX items from Round 1 review.\\n\\n## Changes from PROPOSAL-6\\n\\n### FIX-1 (A-1 MUST FIX): Simplify PhaseInput — remove PhaseSpec\\n\\nPROPOSAL-6 passed `PhaseInput(phase_spec=PhaseSpec)` across workflow boundaries. PhaseSpec.owner_roles is `frozenset[RoleId]` which is **not JSON-serializable** by Temporal's default data converter — this would raise TypeError at serialize time.\\n\\n**Fix:** PhaseInput carries only the StrEnum-typed phase_id. Child workflows reconstruct PhaseSpec from the canonical PHASE_SPECS registry (already available at import time, no I/O needed).\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass PhaseInput:\\n    epoch_id: str\\n    phase_id: PhaseId\\n    # NO phase_spec — reconstructed from PHASE_SPECS in child workflow\\n\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass PhaseResult:\\n    phase_id: PhaseId\\n    success: bool\\n    blocker_count: int = 0\\n    vote_result: VoteType | None = None\\n```\\n\\n**Why this is safe:** PHASE_SPECS is a module-level constant built from canonical Python types. Every worker process loads the same dict at import time — no network I/O, no side effects. Child workflows call `PHASE_SPECS[phase_input.phase_id]` immediately after receiving PhaseInput.\\n\\n**Rule:** EpochState (mutable runtime state) NEVER crosses workflow boundaries. PhaseInput/PhaseResult carry only primitives and StrEnums.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### FIX-2 (B-1 MUST FIX): Structural enforcement of AuditTrail.query_events\\n\\nPROPOSAL-6 marked `query_events` as ACTIVITY-ONLY via docstring only. Temporal's non-determinism detector won't catch a direct call from workflow context — it will corrupt the audit log silently.\\n\\n**Fix:** Add a dedicated registered activity:\\n\\n```python\\n# scripts/aura_protocol/audit_activities.py\\n\\n@activity.defn\\nasync def query_audit_events(\\n    trail: AuditTrail,\\n    epoch_id: str,\\n    phase_id: PhaseId | None = None,\\n) -\\u003e list[AuditEvent]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Registered activity — the ONLY way workflows may read audit events.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    return await trail.query_events(epoch_id=epoch_id, phase_id=phase_id)\\n```\\n\\n`AuditTrail.query_events()` remains on the Protocol interface for direct use in non-workflow contexts (scripts, tests, adapters). Workflows MUST call `query_audit_events` via `workflow.execute_activity(query_audit_events, ...)`.\\n\\n**Linting enforcement:** A comment in AuditTrail.query_events warns that direct calls in workflow context are forbidden. A future ast-grep rule can enforce this statically.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### FIX-3 (B-1 MUST FIX): Document child workflow join semantics\\n\\nAdded explicit documentation for how the parent EpochWorkflow awaits child phase workflows:\\n\\n```python\\n# EpochWorkflow (parent):\\nresult: PhaseResult = await workflow.execute_child_workflow(\\n    ReviewPhaseWorkflow.run,\\n    PhaseInput(epoch_id=self._epoch_id, phase_id=PhaseId.P4_REVIEW),\\n    id=f\\\"{self._epoch_id}-p4\\\",\\n)\\n# Parent blocks here until child returns PhaseResult.\\n# Child independently:\\n#   1. Registers signal handlers for PhaseAdvanceSignal + ReviewVoteSignal\\n#   2. Drains its signal queue via workflow.wait_condition()\\n#   3. Returns PhaseResult when complete\\n```\\n\\nJoin semantics: `workflow.execute_child_workflow()` is an awaitable that resolves only when the child workflow completes and returns. The parent does not poll — it suspends at the await point.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Everything else unchanged from PROPOSAL-6\\n\\nAll items from PROPOSAL-6 that were not flagged as MUST FIX remain unchanged:\\n\\n### Scope (R1-R12 + R14 only)\\n\\nACP-related requirements (R13, R15, R16, R17) deferred to a future `aura-acp` plugin epic (aura-plugins-eocq reference).

Temporal serializes ALL activity arguments via JSON DataConverter. `AuditTrail` is a `@runtime_checkable Protocol` — it has no JSON representation and cannot be deserialized on the worker side. Confirmed via Temporal SDK `worker/_activity.py` lines 551-564 and `converter.py value_to_type`.\\n\\nActivityEnvironment (used in tests) bypasses serialization — this bug would not be caught by existing test infrastructure.\\n\\n### Fix\\nUse the standard Temporal DI pattern: class-based activity with the dependency injected via `__init__`.

Neither `epoch_id` nor `phase_id` are valid kwargs — this is a TypeError at call time.\\n\\n### Fix\\nUpdate the `AuditTrail` Protocol to match the needed call signature. Rename `phase` → `phase_id` for consistency with `PhaseInput.phase_id` and add `epoch_id`:\\n\\n```python\\n# scripts/aura_protocol/interfaces.py (AuditTrail update)\\n\\nasync def query_events(\\n    self,\\n    *,\\n    epoch_id: str | None = None,\\n    phase_id: PhaseId | None = None,\\n    role: RoleId | None = None,\\n) -\\u003e list[AuditEvent]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Query recorded audit events with optional filters.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        epoch_id: Optional epoch filter — only return events for this epoch.\\n        phase_id: Optional phase filter — only return events from this phase.\\n        role:     Optional role filter — only return events from this role.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    ...\\n```\\n\\n**Breaking change scope:** `AuditTrail.query_events` parameter rename (`phase` → `phase_id`). In v3 this is a new interface — no external callers exist yet. Existing tests in test_interfaces.py that use `query_events(phase=...)` must be updated to `query_events(phase_id=...)`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-3 (B-1 MUST FIX): ChildWorkflowHandle retained for signal routing\\n\\n### Problem\\nPROPOSAL-7 routed signals to child workflows via `workflow.get_external_workflow_handle(child_id).signal()`. This raises `WorkflowNotFoundError` if the child has already completed — a race condition that would fail the parent workflow silently.\\n\\n### Fix\\nRetain the `ChildWorkflowHandle` from `start_child_workflow`. This handle knows the child's completion state and provides typed signal routing without re-lookup:\\n\\n```python\\n# In EpochWorkflow.run():\\nchild_handle: ChildWorkflowHandle[PhaseResult] = await workflow.start_child_workflow(\\n    ReviewPhaseWorkflow.run,\\n    PhaseInput(epoch_id=self._epoch_id, phase_id=PhaseId.P4_REVIEW),\\n    id=f'{self._epoch_id}-p4',\\n)\\n\\n# Route a vote signal to the child:\\nawait child_handle.signal(ReviewPhaseWorkflow.submit_vote, vote_signal)\\n\\n# Await completion (blocking join — parent suspends until child returns PhaseResult):\\nresult: PhaseResult = await child_handle\\n```\\n\\n**Child workflow join semantics (explicit):**\\n- `start_child_workflow` registers the child and returns a handle immediately (non-blocking).\\n- `await child_handle` is the blocking join — parent suspends here until child workflow completes and returns `PhaseResult`.\\n- Child independently registers signal handlers (via class-level `@workflow.signal` decorators — see FIX-4) and awaits via `wait_condition` predicate.\\n- Signaling a completed child raises `ChildWorkflowError` from the handle; wrap in try/except if votes can arrive after child completes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-4 (A-1 SHOULD FIX): Class-level @workflow.signal for signal buffering\\n\\nChild workflows (ReviewPhaseWorkflow, SliceWorkflow) MUST use class-level `@workflow.signal` decorators — NOT imperative handler registration inside `run()`.\\n\\n```python\\nclass ReviewPhaseWorkflow:\\n    def __init__(self) -\\u003e None:\\n        self._votes: dict[str, VoteType] = {}\\n\\n    @workflow.signal\\n    def submit_vote(self, signal: ReviewVoteSignal) -\\u003e None:\\n        self._votes[signal.axis] = signal.vote\\n\\n    @workflow.run\\n    async def run(self, input: PhaseInput) -\\u003e PhaseResult:\\n        # wait_condition: predicate gate — NOT a queue drain\\n        await workflow.wait_condition(\\n            lambda: all(ax in self._votes for ax in ('A', 'B', 'C'))\\n        )\\n        vote_result = VoteType.ACCEPT if all(\\n            v == VoteType.ACCEPT for v in self._votes.values()\\n        ) else VoteType.REVISE\\n        ...\\n```\\n\\nRationale: Temporal buffers signals sent before the first workflow task executes, but ONLY if the handler is registered at class definition time (via decorator). Imperative handlers miss signals that arrive during startup latency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-5 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): Public gate constant renamed REVISE_DRIVE_BACK_PHASES\\n\\nMaking the gate constants public (state_machine.py):\\n- `_CONSENSUS_GATED` → `CONSENSUS_GATED`: `frozenset[tuple[PhaseId, PhaseId]]` — set of (from, to) transition pairs requiring reviewer consensus\\n- `_BLOCKER_GATED` → `BLOCKER_GATED`: `frozenset[tuple[PhaseId, PhaseId]]` — transition pairs blocked by outstanding BLOCKER findings\\n- `_REVISE_DRIVES_BACK` → `REVISE_DRIVE_BACK_PHASES`: `frozenset[PhaseId]` — phases where a REVISE vote causes regression to the previous proposal phase\\n\\nThe rename `REVISE_DRIVES_BACK → REVISE_DRIVE_BACK_PHASES` communicates the type (set of PhaseId, not transition pairs) to external callers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-6 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): ToolCall field rename documented as v3 breaking change\\n\\nIn v3, `ToolCall` fields are renamed to match A2A/ACP camelCase JSON alias conventions (R14):\\n\\n| v2 field | v3 field | JSON alias |\\n|----------|----------|------------|\\n| `tool_input` | `raw_input` | `rawInput` |\\n| `tool_output` | `raw_output` | `rawOutput` |\\n| (new) | `tool_call_id` | `toolCallId` |\\n\\n**Rationale for `raw_` prefix:** These fields hold untyped `dict[str, Any]` payloads — the `raw_` prefix distinguishes them from typed or processed forms and signals that callers should not make assumptions about their schema.\\n\\n**v3 migration:** `tool_input` → `raw_input` and `tool_output` → `raw_output` are call-site breaking renames.

The Temporal Python SDK has a distinct, typed API for class-method activities: `workflow.execute_activity_method()`. Using the untyped form violates the project guideline to prefer strongly-typed APIs over stringly-typed dispatch.\\n\\nNote: B-1 confirmed via SDK source that both forms resolve the activity name correctly (from_callable handles bound methods). This is a type-safety fix, not a correctness fix — but the typed API is the right choice per project conventions.\\n\\n### Fix\\n```python\\nresult = await workflow.execute_activity_method(\\n    AuditActivities.query_audit_events,\\n    args=[epoch_id, phase_id],\\n    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),\\n)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-2 (A-1 + B-1 MUST FIX): try/except around child_handle.signal()\\n\\n### Problem\\n`ChildWorkflowHandle.signal()` raises `ApplicationError` (via `FailureError`) if the child workflow has already completed.

Any implementation using `asyncio.gather` is INCORRECT in Temporal workflow code — `asyncio.gather` uses a non-deterministic scheduler order that differs between original execution and replay, causing nondeterminism errors. The Temporal sandbox does not replace or intercept `asyncio.gather`.\\n\\n### Fix\\nParallel child workflows MUST use `workflow.wait()` or `workflow.as_completed()` — the SDK-provided deterministic replacements.\\n\\nCorrect pattern for parallel P9_SLICE execution:\\n```python\\n# Start all slice child workflows\\nhandles = [\\n    await workflow.start_child_workflow(\\n        SliceWorkflow.run,\\n        SliceInput(epoch_id=self._epoch_id, slice_id=s.id),\\n        id=f'{self._epoch_id}-{s.id}',\\n    )\\n    for s in slices\\n]\\n\\n# Await all completions deterministically\\ndone, _ = await workflow.wait(set(handles))\\nresults: list[SliceResult] = [h.result() for h in done]\\n```\\n\\nDO NOT use: ~~`asyncio.gather(*handles)`~~ — non-deterministic replay.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-4 (A-1 + B-1 MUST FIX): ReviewAxis(StrEnum) for vote tracking\\n\\n### Problem\\nPROPOSAL-8 showed:\\n```python\\n_votes: dict[str, VoteType] = {}\\nawait workflow.wait_condition(lambda: all(ax in self._votes for ax in ('A', 'B', 'C')))\\n```\\n\\nRaw string literals violate the project's strongly-typed enum guideline. If axes change or expand, the predicate silently becomes wrong. Also, `ReviewVoteSignal.axis: str` is stringly-typed at the signal boundary.\\n\\n### Fix\\nIntroduce `ReviewAxis(StrEnum)` (or confirm it already exists in types.py — check and use if present):\\n\\n```python\\nclass ReviewAxis(StrEnum):\\n    A = 'A'  # End-user alignment\\n    B = 'B'  # Temporal concurrency\\n    C = 'C'  # Interface design\\n\\nclass ReviewVoteSignal:\\n    axis: ReviewAxis  # was: str\\n\\nclass ReviewPhaseWorkflow:\\n    def __init__(self) -\\u003e None:\\n        self._votes: dict[ReviewAxis, VoteType] = {}\\n\\n    @workflow.signal\\n    def submit_vote(self, signal: ReviewVoteSignal) -\\u003e None:\\n        self._votes[signal.axis] = signal.vote\\n\\n    @workflow.run\\n    async def run(self, input: PhaseInput) -\\u003e PhaseResult:\\n        # Predicate: all 3 axes have voted — exhaustive, enum-safe\\n        await workflow.wait_condition(\\n            lambda: all(ax in self._votes for ax in ReviewAxis)\\n        )\\n```\\n\\nThis is exhaustive (iterates over all enum members), self-documenting, and correct when axes are added.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-5 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): Keep AuditTrail.query_events phase parameter name\\n\\n### Problem\\nPROPOSAL-8 renamed `query_events(*, phase: PhaseId)` to `query_events(*, phase_id: PhaseId)`. Reviewer C found that `AuditEvent.phase` (not `AuditEvent.phase_id`) is the field name in types.py. Renaming the query parameter creates split terminology: callers do `trail.query_events(phase_id=event.phase)` everywhere — constant friction.\\n\\n### Fix\\nKeep `phase` as the parameter name. Only ADD `epoch_id`:\\n\\n```python\\nasync def query_events(\\n    self,\\n    *,\\n    epoch_id: str | None = None,\\n    phase: PhaseId | None = None,\\n    role: RoleId | None = None,\\n) -\\u003e list[AuditEvent]:\\n    ...\\n```\\n\\nThe `AuditActivities.query_audit_events` activity wrapper passes it through correctly:\\n```python\\nasync def query_audit_events(self, epoch_id: str, phase: PhaseId | None = None) -\\u003e list[AuditEvent]:\\n    return await self._trail.query_events(epoch_id=epoch_id, phase=phase)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-6 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): _REVISE_DRIVES_BACK_PHASES — keep private prefix, fix grammar\\n\\n### Problem\\nPROPOSAL-8 proposed `REVISE_DRIVE_BACK_PHASES` (public, grammatically wrong — 'DRIVE' not 'DRIVES'). Making the constant public also removes the `_` prefix without justification.\\n\\n### Fix\\nKeep the constant private and fix the grammar:\\n\\n```python\\n# state_machine.py\\n_CONSENSUS_GATED: frozenset[tuple[PhaseId, PhaseId]] = frozenset({...})\\n_BLOCKER_GATED: frozenset[tuple[PhaseId, PhaseId]] = frozenset({...})\\n_REVISE_DRIVES_BACK_PHASES: frozenset[PhaseId] = frozenset({...})  # was: _REVISE_DRIVES_BACK (no _PHASES suffix)\\n```\\n\\nThe `_PHASES` suffix communicates the type (set of PhaseId, not transition tuples). The `_` prefix keeps it private to the state machine module. Child workflows that need gate logic call `EpochStateMachine` methods — they do not read the raw constants directly.\\n\\nIf these constants are genuinely needed by external callers (child workflows, tests), expose them via a typed accessor method on `EpochStateMachine` instead of promoting them to public module-level constants.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-7 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): ToolCall migration — optional tool_call_id default\\n\\n### Problem\\nPROPOSAL-8 added required `tool_call_id: str` at position 2 in the dataclass. Inserting a required field in the middle of an existing frozen dataclass is a positional migration hazard: existing `ToolCall(tool_name=..., tool_input=...)` callers get TypeError.\\n\\n### Fix\\nMake `tool_call_id` optional with empty string default (v3 migration path):\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass ToolCall:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"MCP-compatible tool call representation.\\n\\n    v3 changes:\\n    - tool_input renamed to raw_input (camelCase JSON alias: rawInput)\\n    - tool_output renamed to raw_output (camelCase JSON alias: rawOutput)\\n    - tool_call_id added (camelCase JSON alias: toolCallId); defaults to '' for migration\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    tool_name: str\\n    raw_input: dict[str, Any]               # was: tool_input\\n    raw_output: dict[str, Any] | None = None  # was: tool_output\\n    tool_call_id: str = ''                  # new in v3; default eases migration\\n```\\n\\nOrdering: required fields first (tool_name, raw_input), then optionals (raw_output, tool_call_id). The rename tool_input→raw_input still requires test migration (test_interfaces.py L369-393) — this is explicitly documented as a v3 API boundary, no shim.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-8 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): FilePart docstring update when FileWithUri lands\\n\\nThe existing `FilePart` docstring (interfaces.py L173-177) says: 'Migration to the nested A2A file_with_uri structure is deferred to v2 scope.' When SLICE-2 adds `FileWithUri` and updates `FilePart.file_with_uri`, the SLICE implementor MUST update this docstring atomically. Tracked as a SLICE-2 acceptance criterion.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-9 (B-1 SHOULD FIX): ApplicationError(non_retryable=True) for permanent failures\\n\\n`AuditActivities.query_audit_events` error handling:\\n- **Transient failures** (backend unreachable, timeout): let propagate — Temporal's default retry policy handles these.\\n- **Permanent failures** (epoch not found, invalid query, schema mismatch): raise `ApplicationError('reason', non_retryable=True)` inside the activity. This immediately marks the activity as failed without retrying.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom temporalio.exceptions import ApplicationError\\n\\nasync def query_audit_events(self, epoch_id: str, phase: PhaseId | None = None) -\\u003e list[AuditEvent]:\\n    try:\\n        return await self._trail.query_events(epoch_id=epoch_id, phase=phase)\\n    except EpochNotFoundError as e:\\n        raise ApplicationError(str(e), non_retryable=True) from e\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Unchanged from PROPOSAL-8\\n\\nAll items from PROPOSAL-8 not modified above remain unchanged:\\n\\n- **PhaseInput:** `epoch_id: str`, `phase: PhaseId` only — child workflows reconstruct PhaseSpec from PHASE_SPECS\\n- **PhaseResult:** `phase_id: PhaseId`, `success: bool`, `blocker_count: int = 0`, `vote_result: VoteType | None = None`\\n- **AuditActivities class-based DI pattern:** confirmed VALID by B-1 via SDK source\\n- **ChildWorkflowHandle retained** from start_child_workflow (not get_external_workflow_handle re-lookup)\\n- **Class-level @workflow.signal decorators** in child workflows (buffering correctness)\\n- **FileWithUri(uri, name, mime_type)**, FilePart.file_with_uri: FileWithUri\\n- **NullTranscriptRecorder + NullSecurityGate** (R12 stub labels)\\n- **No agent-client-protocol dependency**\\n- **5 slices**; Infrastructure: bin/worker.py + nix/temporal-service.nix + NixOS systemd module\\n- **Test baseline:** 945 existing tests; SLICE-5 targets no regressions\\n\\n## Decision log\\n\\nD1: PhaseInput carries phase_id (PhaseId) only — PhaseSpec reconstructed from PHASE_SPECS in child workflow.\\nD2: AuditActivities class-based DI — trail injected at worker startup, never serialized.\\nD3: AuditTrail.query_events adds epoch_id; keeps phase (matches AuditEvent.phase field name).\\nD4: ChildWorkflowHandle from start_child_workflow — signal routing with try/except ApplicationError guard.\\nD5: Child workflows use class-level @workflow.signal decorators for buffering correctness.\\nD6: Parallel P9_SLICE uses workflow.wait() — asyncio.gather is PROHIBITED in workflow code.\\nD7: ReviewAxis(StrEnum) replaces raw strings in vote tracking and wait_condition.\\nD8: _REVISE_DRIVES_BACK_PHASES — private, grammar fixed, _PHASES suffix added.\\nD9: ToolCall: tool_call_id optional default '' for v3 migration; raw_input/raw_output rename is breaking at v3 boundary.\\nD10: execute_activity_method() is the typed SDK API for class-method activities.\",\"status\":\"open\",\"priority\":2,\"issue_type\":\"task\",\"assignee\":\"architect\",\"owner\":\"dayvidpham@gmail.com\",\"created_at\":\"2026-02-26T15:09:09Z\",\"created_by\":\"David Huu Pham\",\"updated_at\":\"2026-02-26T15:09:09Z\"}"}

Minimal targeted fixes: C-1 MUST FIX + 2 SHOULD FIX items.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-1 (C-1 MUST FIX): ReviewVoteSignal.axis: ReviewAxis\\n\\n### Problem\\nPROPOSAL-9 FIX-4 introduced `_votes: dict[ReviewAxis, VoteType]` in ReviewPhaseWorkflow but left `ReviewVoteSignal.axis: str`. The assignment `self._votes[signal.axis] = signal.vote` is a type error: `str` is not assignable to `ReviewAxis` as a typed dict key. This is a self-introduced type incoherence within the same proposal.\\n\\n### Fix\\nUpdate ReviewVoteSignal (existing definition in workflow.py, lines 113-124):\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass ReviewVoteSignal:\\n    axis: ReviewAxis   # was: str\\n    vote: VoteType\\n    reviewer_id: str\\n```\\n\\nReviewAxis already exists in types.py (lines 106-114) with members A, B, C. Since ReviewAxis is a StrEnum, existing callers passing raw strings ('A', 'B', 'C') continue to work at runtime. Tests should be updated to use ReviewAxis.A etc. for type correctness.\\n\\nEpochStateMachine.record_vote(axis: str, ...) currently uses str. After this change, the correct approach is to accept both during migration: axis: ReviewAxis | str. Since ReviewAxis is a StrEnum, a ReviewAxis value passes isinstance(v, str) — no runtime breakage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-2 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): tool_call_id: str | None = None\\n\\n### Problem\\nPROPOSAL-9 FIX-7 proposed `tool_call_id: str = ''`. Empty string is semantically ambiguous: in MCP protocol, tool_call_id is a mandatory correlation identifier. An empty string has no natural interpretation as 'absent'. It lies about optionality — the type says str (always present) but the semantics mean 'not provided in v2 records'.\\n\\n### Fix\\n```python\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass ToolCall:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"MCP-compatible tool call representation.\\n\\n    v3 changes:\\n    - tool_input renamed to raw_input (JSON alias: rawInput)\\n    - tool_output renamed to raw_output (JSON alias: rawOutput)\\n    - tool_call_id added (JSON alias: toolCallId); None for v2-origin records\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    tool_name: str\\n    raw_input: dict[str, Any]               # was: tool_input\\n    raw_output: dict[str, Any] | None = None  # was: tool_output\\n    tool_call_id: str | None = None         # new in v3; None for v2-origin records\\n```\\n\\n`None` is the standard Python sentinel for 'absent optional identifier'. Callers can check `if tool_call.tool_call_id:` cleanly; serialization produces null in JSON (not '').\\n\\n---\\n\\n## FIX-3 (C-1 SHOULD FIX): AuditTrail.query_events epoch_id optionality — documented design decision\\n\\n### Problem\\n`AuditTrail.query_events` makes `epoch_id: str | None = None` (optional), but the `query_audit_events` activity wrapper makes `epoch_id: str` required (non-optional). A consumer using the Protocol directly can issue cross-epoch queries that the activity disallows. This optionality mismatch is a learnable API confusion.\\n\\n### Decision\\nKeep `epoch_id` optional in the Protocol to allow cross-epoch queries as an advanced use case (scripts, admin tooling, tests). The activity wrapper makes it required because workflows always have an epoch_id — they should never issue unbounded cross-epoch queries in a running workflow.\\n\\nDocument this intent explicitly in the Protocol:\\n\\n```python\\nasync def query_events(\\n    self,\\n    *,\\n    epoch_id: str | None = None,\\n    phase: PhaseId | None = None,\\n    role: RoleId | None = None,\\n) -\\u003e list[AuditEvent]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Query recorded audit events with optional filters.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        epoch_id: Optional epoch filter.
